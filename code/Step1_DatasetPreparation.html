<pre>[u&#39;Mount Sinjar: Islamic State siege broken, say Kurds\nKurdish security forces have been trying to stem the IS advance across Iraq\&#39;s northern Nineveh province\nWhat the Kassig video tells us\nKurdish forces in northern Iraq are claiming their biggest victory yet against Islamic State (IS) militants.\nThey say they have broken the IS siege of Mount Sinjar, where thousands of Yazidis and other displaced Iraqis have been trapped since August.\nIS controls a swathe of Iraq and Syria, where it has declared a caliphate.\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon\&#39;s top officer says US air strikes have killed several high-ranking military leaders of IS in Iraq.\nThe Kurdish offensive against IS forces besieging Mount Sinjar began early on Wednesday with the most intensive round of air strikes yet by US and coalition forces - 45 in all.\nKurdish security forces have been trying to stem the IS advance across Iraq\&#39;s northern Nineveh province\nKurdish forces opened a wide corridor, allowing those trapped by IS to leave\nIS forces control significant swathes of territory\nThousands of Yazidi and other displaced Iraqis have fled violence in the town of Sinjar\nOn the ground, about 8,000 Kurdish peshmerga fighters launched a two-pronged attack which they said had succeeded in opening a wide corridor to allow members of the Yazidi minority and others to leave.\nMasrur Barzani, Chancellor of the Kurdistan Region Security Council, said the operation had been to advance from Zumar - which Kurdish forces recaptured in October - to Mount Sinjar and to rescue the Yazidi people trapped there.\n&#34;It was a very big operation and thankfully it was concluded very successfully,&#34; he said.\nPeshmerga commanders said they expected the evacuation of those trapped on the mountain to begin on Friday.\nA statement from the Kurdish command said large numbers of militant fighters had fled westwards into Syria or eastwards towards Mosul, which they captured in June.\nThe peshmerga also said eight villages had been recaptured and about 80 militants killed in the offensive.\nThe BBC\&#39;s Jim Muir says that if the Kurds have done all they say, it is a significant advance.\nBut he adds that there is still a long way to go - the town of Sinjar itself, to the south of the mountain, remains in IS hands, as do Mosul and the nearby town of Tal Afar.\nIS captured the town of Sinjar in August forcing thousands of residents, mainly from the Yazidi sect, to flee. Many were airlifted off the nearby mountain but thousands more who came later found themselves trapped.\n\&#39;High-value targets\&#39;\nThe attack on Sinjar was one of the reasons the US began air strikes against IS positions in Iraq in August. It expanded its air campaign into Syria the following month.\nMartin Dempsey: &#34;These are high-value targets, senior leadership&#34;\nGen Martin Dempsey, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the air strikes that had killed the IS leaders were designed to hamper the Islamist group\&#39;s ability to conduct attacks, supply fighters and finance operations.\nGen Dempsey told the Wall Street Journal that the loss of IS leaders was &#34;disruptive to their planning and command and control&#34;.\nHe added: &#34;These are high-value targets, senior leadership.&#34;\nPentagon officials said that between 3 and 9 December, US air strikes killed Abd al-Basit, head of IS military operations in Iraq, and Haji Mutazz, a key aide of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\nThey added that in late November another strike killed Radwin Talib, IS governor of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul.\nOther defence officials said a number of senior and mid-level IS commanders had also died in air strikes, and that they believed this was beginning to significantly weaken the group\&#39;s leadership structure.\nMore on This Story\nThe battle for guns at university\nMost Popular\n&#39;, u&#39;Cairns deaths: Eight children found in Australian home\nMurray Street in the Manoora suburb of Cairns has been closed off by police\nEight children have been found dead at a house in Cairns in northern Queensland, say Australian police.\nPolice said a 34-year-old woman had been taken to hospital with stab wounds but was stable.\nThe details of the incident and the woman\&#39;s relationship to the children, aged between 18 months and 15 years, are not yet clear.\nAustralian reports say the children were stabbed but police have not confirmed this.\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a statement it was an &#34;unspeakable crime&#34;, and that all parents would feel &#34;gut-wrenching sadness at what has happened&#34;.\nBruno Asnicar of Cairns Police said that the scenes his officers had witnessed were &#34;extremely distressing&#34;\nThe house in the Manoora suburb has been cordoned off and detectives are searching the yard.\nPolice have said it was a &#34;tragic event&#34; but there was no cause for public concern.\nThey have not made any arrests, but said the injured woman was assisting with their investigations.\nThe BBC\&#39;s Jon Donnison in Sydney says it appears police are not looking for any suspects.\nPolice have been comforting shocked local residents outside the house\nThe Australian Associated Press news agency quoted a woman as saying she was the injured woman\&#39;s cousin and that the children were siblings.\nCairns Detective Inspector Bruno Asnicar told reporters he could not confirm whether the children were from the same family.\nHe said police currently believed there were eight children involved but &#34;that may go up or down&#34; as the house was searched.\n&#34;These events are extremely distressing for everyone, of course, and police officers aren\&#39;t immune to that, we\&#39;re human beings as well,&#34; he said.\nAAP reporter Cleo Lane at the scene told the BBC residents were standing in the street in shock.\nQueensland Police said in a statement earlier that they were called to a residence in Murray Street at 11.20 local time (01:20 GMT) following reports of a woman with serious injuries.\n&#34;During an examination of the residence police located the bodies of the children, all aged between 18 months and 15 years,&#34; said the statement.\nQueensland Premier Campbell Newman said he was &#34;deeply saddened and shocked&#34; by the events.\n&#34;Indeed, the whole Cairns community and the people of Queensland will feel the effects of this tragedy, particularly at a time of year when families come together.&#34;\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Sony hack: White House views attack as security issue\nThe Interview stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as journalists enlisted to kill Kim Jong-un\nSony scraps The Interview worldwide Watch\nA cyber attack on Sony Pictures that forced the cancellation of a major film release is being seen as a serious national security matter, the US says.\nA White House spokesman said the US believed the hacking was the work of a &#34;sophisticated actor&#34; - but refused to confirm if North Korea was responsible.\nSony withdrew The Interview, a new comedy film about North Korea\&#39;s leader, after threats from hackers.\nHackers have already released sensitive information stored on Sony computers.\nThey later issued a warning to members of the public planning to see The Interview.\nReferring to the 11 September 2001 terror attacks, they said &#34;the world will be full of fear&#34; if the film was screened.\nEx-hacker Marc Maiffret: \&#39;It\&#39;s easy to break into companies like Sony\&#39;\nTeam America \&#39;pulled\&#39;\nThree cinemas said replacement screenings of Team America, a film which ridicules the former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, had also been cancelled.\nThe Plaza Atlanta and Ohio\&#39;s Capitol Theatre both tweeted their screenings had been cancelled by the film\&#39;s makers Paramount Pictures, while the Alamo Drafthouse said the film had been &#34;removed from release&#34;.

Russia\&#39;s behaviour needs a pragmatic solution, a united, common position.&#34;\nPoland, bordering on Ukraine, has long had tense relations with Russia, and is among the most vocal critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nCrimea targeted\nPro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine still have heavy weapons including tanks and rockets, despite demands by Ukraine and the West for them to disarm. Continuing clashes in the Donetsk region have undermined peace efforts.\nUnder the latest measures against Russia, all EU tour operators will be barred from operating in Crimea and European investment there will be banned. Russia annexed Crimea in March.\nItaly\&#39;s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said &#34;we must work with Russia to push it out of Ukraine&#34;.\nFighting continues in eastern Ukraine, despite appeals by the EU\nAnd EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed that the EU\&#39;s channels of communication with Russia must remain open.\nThere was much surprise among the summit journalists that Mr Tusk managed to reduce the expected two-day summit to one afternoon and evening. Usually EU summits go on hours longer than planned, often into the early morning.\nInvestment plan\nThe other main topic was Mr Juncker\&#39;s plan to generate \x80315bn (\u0141250bn; $392bn) of private investment for infrastructure projects in the EU.\nIt got the leaders\&#39; approval, and the aim is to launch it next June.\nMr Juncker said the commission would &#34;look favourably&#34; on government participation in big investment schemes, and would &#34;neutralise&#34; national contributions to the new fund. That suggests more lenient deficit targets for governments that boost investment.\nItaly, burdened by colossal debts and high unemployment, warmly welcomed the Juncker plan.\nMr Renzi said investment decisions would involve &#34;politicians, not only technocrats&#34; and he stressed that for years Italy had been urging flexibility in reaching budget targets set by the commission.\n&#34;Growth and not only austerity is the legacy of the Italian presidency [of the EU],&#34; he said.\nHe and French President Francois Hollande - both centre-left leaders  - have urged Germany and other pro-austerity states to encourage much-needed growth, by allowing a monetary stimulus in the eurozone.\nMore on This Story\n17 DECEMBER 2014, INSIDE EUROPE BLOG\nFrom other news sites\nThe battle for guns at university\nMost Popular\n&#39;, u&#39;Insular US Secret Service needs external boss - report\nThe White House is meant to be one of the most secure sites in the US\nWhite House security lapses detailed\nThe US Secret Service, which guards the US president, is too insular and must recruit its next head externally, a review prompted by a White House security breach says.\nThe report, a summary of which was released by the Homeland Security Department, said the agency needed more plainclothes and uniformed staff.\nIt added that the White House needed a new, taller fence.\nThe review came after an intruder with a knife entered the building.\nOmar Gonzalez, a former US soldier, was apprehended deep inside the presidential residence in September after he had scaled a fence around the building and evaded several guards - including one with an attack dog.\nJulia Pearson, the Secret Service director at the time, resigned partly as a result of this breach.\nThe Secret Service is tasked with guarding the US president, as well as several senior government officials.\nAccording to an executive summary of the independent review, the agency\&#39;s next director &#34;will have to make difficult choices, identifying clear priorities for the organisation and holding management accountable for any failure to achieve those priorities&#34;.\nThe Secret Service director at the time, Julia Pierson, has since resigned\n&#34;Only a director from outside the [Secret] Service, removed from organisational traditions and personal relationships, will be able to do the honest top-to-bottom reassessment this will require.&#34;\nThe review also said a better fence should be built &#34;as soon as possible&#34;, recommending one that was several feet higher and curved outwards, making it harder to scale.\nHowever, the review noted that the problems in the agency &#34;go deeper than a new fence can fix&#34;. The panel said the agency\&#39;s staff were over-stretched, working &#34;an unsustainable number of hours&#34;.\nIt called for boosting the service\&#39;s ranks by 85 special agents and 200 uniformed officers, to reduce overtime and allow staff to receive regular training.\nThe four-member panel based its findings on interviews with 50 employees of the Secret Service. The panel admitted that many of its recommendations had been made before - but not implemented.\nMany details have already emerged of the security lapses that allowed Mr Gonzalez to enter the White House, pointing to a lack of training, bad staffing decisions and failures in communication.\nMr Obama and his family were not at the White House when the intrusion happened, having departed about 10 minutes earlier by helicopter.\nMr Gonzalez has been indicted on charges including unlawfully entering a restricted building or grounds while carrying a deadly or dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition.\nThe intrusion came after a series of embarrassing lapses by the Secret Service - including reports that agents had used prostitutes while on duty in Colombia.\nA new barrier was erected following the security breach\nMore on This Story\n30 SEPTEMBER 2014, US &amp;

disagreed with his stance, a message that could resonate in Florida, the traditional home of the Cuban exile community but also a state that is increasingly becoming more diverse and less dominated by Cuban affairs.\nUltimately, comments like these come to show how so-called hardliners still have significant clout when it comes to preventing a new course in bilateral relations, even when common Cubans, especially younger generations, have moved on beyond these traditional views.\nThe US will now seek to set up an embassy in Cuba, expand US visitors to Cuba, open up banking and increase caps on how much cash Cubans can post to relatives on to the island.\nBut only Congress has the power to end the full trade embargo, and with many Republicans deeply opposed to such a change, correspondents say it is unlikely to happen soon.\nAmong those opposed to restoring diplomatic relations was Democratic Senator Robert Menendez who said he was &#34;deeply disappointed&#34;.\nPresident Raul Castro with three released convicted spies\n&#34;It\&#39;s a fallacy to believe that Cuba will reform because an American president opens his hands and the Castro brothers will suddenly unclench their fists.&#34;\nFellow Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, said he would be among those trying to pass legislation to undercut funding for policy changes, including setting up an embassy.\n&#34;Normalising relations with Cuba is a bad idea at a bad time,&#34; tweeted Mr Graham, who will become chairman of a committee that determines state department funding in January.\nRepublican Senator Marco Rubio slammed the deal as &#34;inexplicable&#34;.\n&#34;Appeasing the Castro brothers will only cause other tyrants from Caracas to Tehran to Pyongyang to see that they can take advantage of President Obama\&#39;s naivete during his final two years in office,&#34;

and &#34;radicalising an insurgent group\&#39;s remaining leaders&#34;.\nOn Afghanistan, the report said that targeting senior Taliban figures has been constrained by problems connecting it to broader Afghan and Nato efforts against the organisation.\nIt also says the Taliban has &#34;good succession planning and bench strength, especially at the middle levels&#34;.\nSince the report was written, President Obama has increased drone strikes in north-west Pakistan, targeting Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.\nThere have also been several strikes in Yemen.\nMore on This Story\nThe battle for guns at university\nMost Popular\n&#39;, u&#39;South Korea court bans \&#39;pro-North\&#39;

These are likely the result of biomass burning in these regions.\nIt is possible to see spikes, too, on the eastern seaboard of the US and over China. These probably include the additional emissions of CO2 that come from industrialisation.\n&#34;We\&#39;re very early into the mission and collecting data, yet as we show, we can take five weeks of that information and give you a quick picture of global carbon dioxide,&#34; said deputy project scientist Annmarie Eldering.\n&#34;It really suggests to us that OCO-2 will be very useful for finding out about where carbon dioxide is coming from and being taken back up around the globe,&#34; she told BBC News.\nThe US space agency researcher presented the maps here at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in San Francisco.\nSources and sinks\nThe satellite was launched this year as a replacement for an earlier venture that was destroyed in 2009 when its rocket failed soon after lift-off.\nOCO-2\&#39;s key objective is to trace the global geographic distribution of CO2 in the atmosphere - measuring its presence down through the column of air to the planet\&#39;s surface.\nScientists want to know how exactly the greenhouse gas cycles through the Earth system - the carbon cycle.\nHumans add something like 40 billion tonnes of the gas to the atmosphere every year, principally from the burning of fossil fuels.\nBut the ultimate destination of this carbon dioxide is uncertain.  About half is thought to be absorbed into the oceans, with the rest pulled down into land &#34;sinks&#34;.\nIt is hoped OCO-2 can describe those draw-down locations in much more detail.\nEven with this snapshot, scientists can see that some of their existing models will have to be revised.\nArtist\&#39;s impression: The  OCO-2 satellite has an initial mission of two years\nAs part of its presentation, the observatory team showed off a special targeting mode that it can employ on OCO-2.\nThis involves swinging the satellite so that its spectrometer instrument can scan a restricted location in very high resolution.\nCurrently, these places are ones where the project has sophisticated ground equipment to gather measurements that can then validate OCO-2\&#39;s observations from orbit.  But ultimately, the lessons learned could allow the mission to make detailed surveys at other sites, such as megacities known be big emitters.\n&#34;I think the answer to that is \&#39;yes\&#39;, and there are discussions going on now as to whether we can increase the number of places that we can target to look at other interesting locations.\n&#34;But more importantly, though, we are all hoping there will be a follow-on mission called OCO-3, which would directly provide that flexibility in operations.&#34;\nThe Orbiting Carbon Observatory has been spoken of as the forerunner of satellite missions that would seek to gain the information needed to patrol climate treaties, by helping to check that promises made by nations on carbon curbs were being kept.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;New record depth for deepest fish\nBy Rebecca Morelle Science Correspondent, BBC News, San Francisco\nThe fish moves in from the bottom-left of the image towards the baited lander\n\&#39;Supergiant\&#39; found in deepest sea\nA new record has been set for the world\&#39;s deepest fish.\nThe bizarre-looking creature, which is new to science, was filmed 8,145m beneath the waves, beating the previous depth record by nearly 500m.\nSeveral other new species of fish were also caught on camera, as well as huge crustaceans called supergiants.\nThe animals were discovered during an international expedition to the Mariana Trench, which lies almost 11km down in the Pacific Ocean.\nThe 30-day voyage took place from the Schmidt Ocean Institute\&#39;s research vessel, Falkor, and is the most comprehensive survey of world\&#39;s deepest place ever undertaken.\nThe Hadal Ecosystem Studies (Hades) team deployed unmanned landers more than 90 times to depths that ranged between 5,000m and 10,600m. They studied both steep walls of the undersea canyon.\nDr Jeff Drazen, co-chief scientist from the University of Hawaii, US, said: &#34;Many studies have rushed to the bottom of the trench, but from an ecological view that is very limiting.\n&#34;It\&#39;s like trying to understand a mountain ecosystem by only looking at its summit.&#34;\nOcean trench: Take a dive 11,000m down\nThe University of Aberdeen\&#39;s Hadal Lander - the UK\&#39;s deepest diving vehicle - recorded more than 100 hours of deep-sea footage.\nUntil this expedition, the deepest fish had been found in the Japan Trench, also in the Pacific Ocean. A 17-strong shoal of pink, gelatinous snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) were recorded 7,700m down.\nDr Alan Jamieson, from Oceanlab at the University of Aberdeen, said: &#34;After we found these, we started seeing them in other deep trenches. Each trench has its own snailfish species.\n&#34;And we saw one in the Mariana Trench at more than 8,000m, and we think it\&#39;s a new species.&#34;\nThe team thought they had broken the deepest-fish record, but then another pale pink species came to feed at the lander, which is loaded with bait, even further down at 8,145m.\nDr Jamieson said: &#34;We think it is a snailfish, but it\&#39;s so weird-looking; it\&#39;s up in the air in terms of what it is.\n&#34;It is unbelievably fragile, and when it swims, it looks like it has wet tissue paper floating behind it.\n&#34;And it has a weird snout - it looks like a cartoon dog snout.&#34;\nWithout catching the fish and bringing it back to the surface, the team is unable to confirm that it is a new species, but Dr Jamieson said it did not look like anything he\&#39;d seen before or knew of.\nThe new record-breaking creature is close to the depth-limit at which scientists believe fish can survive.\nDecapod shrimp are among the other residents of the deep ocean\nThey researchers also captured another bizarre species - supergiants - on camera.\nThese creatures are a type of amphipod, which are normally around 2-3cm long. The super-sized version can reach up to 30cm.\nDr Jamieson said: &#34;We\&#39;ve got more than 20 hours of footage of them, and we\&#39;re learning the way they swim, the way they feed and the way they fend off predators.\n&#34;They clamp down on the bait, and bore their head into it and put their spiky tail in the air like a thorn bush.\n&#34;Anything that goes for it gets stabbed in the nose.&#34;\nThe dives made during the expedition were all conducted by unmanned vehicles, but humans have visited the world\&#39;s deepest place.\nIn 1960, US Navy Lt Don Walsh and Swiss oceanographer Jacques Piccard made an incredibly risky journey to the bottom of the Mariana Trench in a bathyscaphe called the Trieste.\nAnd in 2012, Hollywood director James Cameron made a solo descent to the seafloor in his sub called the Deepsea Challenger.\nHe described the place as a desolate, alien world.\n26 MARCH 2012, SCIENCE &amp; ENVIRONMENT\nShare this page\nThe battle for guns at university\nMost Popular\n&#39;, u&#39;Man finds travel companion with same name as ex-girlfriend\n18 December 2014\nFrom the section Front Page\nA Canadian man has found a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend to travel with after booking a three-week holiday before they split up.\nJordan Axani, 28, broke up with Elizabeth Gallagher in May but couldn\&#39;t get a refund for the trip.\nAfter putting out a request on Reddit for a travelling companion with the same name and a Canadian passport, he received thousands of responses.\nOne was from student Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher from Nova Scotia.\nJordan picked the 23-year-old, a homeless shelter volunteer who has a boyfriend, after talking with her on the phone.\nHe said he was impressed with her social conscience.\nA friend of Elizabeth Gallagher\&#39;s tweeted a photo of her passport to Jordan Axani in November\n&#34;It\&#39;s totally platonic,&#34; Jordan Axani said from New York, where the trip starts on Sunday.\n&#34;Do I think we\&#39;ll become friends?

In addition to the excessive hours, one reporter had to attend unpaid meetings before and after work.  Another reporter was housed in a dormitory where 12 workers shared a cramped room.\nApple says the dormitory overcrowding has now been resolved and that it requires suppliers to retroactively pay workers if it finds they haven\&#39;t been paid for work meetings.\nPegatron said it was carefully investigating Panorama\&#39;s claims and would take all necessary action if any deficiencies were found at their facilities.\n&#34;Worker safety and well-being are our top priorities.

It\&#39;s not OK just to fire a person because they\&#39;re fat, if they\&#39;re doing their job properly.&#34;\nThe Danish courts asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to clarify whether obesity was a disability.\nThe ECJ ruled that if the obesity of the worker &#34;hinders the full and effective participation of that person in professional life on an equal basis with other workers&#34;, then obesity can fall within the concept of &#34;disability&#34;.\nRulings from the European Court of Justice are binding for all EU member nations.\nThe courts in Denmark will now have to assess Mr Kaltoft\&#39;s weight to see if his case can be classed as a disability.\nAnalysis by Clive Coleman, BBC\&#39;s legal correspondent\nToday\&#39;s ruling was of great interest to employers across Europe. The judgement makes no direct link between Body Mass Index and obesity, but is a powerful statement that an obese worker whose weight hinders their performance at work is entitled to disability protection.\nThat will mean employers must, on a case by case basis, make reasonable adjustments such as providing larger chairs or special car parking, and protect such employees from verbal harassment.\nBut there are wider implications. Providers of goods and services such as shops, cinemas and restaurants will also have to make reasonable adjustments for their customers, which might include things like special seating arrangements.\nThe key concept here is that adjustments must be &#34;reasonable&#34; - so it may be deemed reasonable for a Premier League football club to make two seats available for someone disabled through obesity, but not for a small, non-league club.\nObesity, particularly what is sometimes known as morbid or severe and complex obesity, can be a particularly sensitive subject.\nEmployers and service providers will have to take care not to make assumptions about the needs of an obese worker or customer.\n\&#39;Wider seats\&#39;\nJane Deville Almond, the chairwoman of the British Obesity Society, said obesity should not be classed as a disability.\nShe told the BBC: &#34;I think the downside would be that if employers suddenly have to start ensuring that they\&#39;ve got wider seats, larger tables, more parking spaces for people who are obese, I think then we\&#39;re just making the situation worse.\nEmployers could be required to make their offices more accessible for obese employees\n&#34;[It is] implying that people have no control over the condition, rather than something that can be greatly improved by changing behaviour.&#34;\nPaul Callaghan, head of employment law at international law firm Taylor Wessing, said the ruling does not change UK law.\n&#34;The European Court of Justice has ruled that obesity itself is not a disability, but that the effects of it can be.\n&#34;As such, workers who suffer from, for example, joint problems, depression, or diabetes - specifically because of their size - will be protected by the European Equal Treatment Framework Directive and cannot be dismissed because of their weight.&#34;\nEmployers\&#39; responsibility\nAudrey Williams, employment law partner at Eversheds, said the mere fact someone is obese is not enough to make them disabled.\n&#34;What the court are saying is that obesity is not protected unless it hinders professional life.&#34;\nShe said the ruling would increase awareness among employers of their responsibility towards obese employees in the workplace.\nThis could include making reasonable adjustments to working arrangements, seating arrangements or making access to the office easier.\nHowever, Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the ruling had opened a can of worms for UK employers.\n&#34;They will be required to make adjustments to their furniture and doors and whatever is needed for very large people.\n&#34;I believe it will also cause friction in the workplace between obese people and other workers.&#34;\nOne in four people in the UK is classified as obese.\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;print\nAlbert Ebosse: New tests claim Cameroonian died after beating\nNew post-mortem tests indicate Cameroonian footballer Albert Ebosse died as a result of a beating rather than being hit by a projectile.\nThe JS Kabylie striker died in August after his side lost a league match.\nFindings by the Algerian authorities stated that the 24-year-old was killed by a sharp projectile thrown by fans.\nBut pathologist Andre Moune told BBC World TV: &#34;When you see the injuries to his shoulders, the only way that can be explained is by a physical attack.&#34;\nThe Cameroonian carried out the tests at the request of Ebosse\&#39;s family.\nHe reported the player received &#34;a blow to the head&#34; that caused &#34;an indentation of the skull&#34; that impacted his brain and that he had suffered upper body injuries indicating &#34;signs of struggle&#34;.\nOther signs of violence included &#34;rupture of cervical vertebrae&#34; and a wound to the shoulder.\nHis findings have been sent to Algerian and Cameroonian authorities for further action.\nMoune added: &#34;Shortly after his death, we saw a video of Ebosse, after the match, surrounded by police and leaving the pitch to enter the dressing room.\n&#34;We didn\&#39;t see anything happen to him on the pitch or anything that prevented him leaving the pitch because of a missile.\n&#34;It can\&#39;t be a slate tile, as the Algerians stated in their report, because if someone threw a tile, even at high speed, it couldn\&#39;t cause such severe wounds like the ones I found on the body.\n&#34;For such an object to break through into the skull, it needs a heavy strength. The object that hit him came from close range.&#34;\nThe official Algerian version suggested Ebosse died in hospital on 23 August from head injuries sustained as he left the pitch under a hail of objects thrown from the stands.\nAlbert Ebosse\&#39;s body was returned to Cameroon after his death\nAt the time, Algerian Sports Minister Mohamed Tahmi said Ebosse died after being struck by a piece of sharp slate.\nTahmi has refused to comment on the new test results.\nEbosse\&#39;s family said they had urged Cameroonian authorities and the Confederation of African Football to take action following the new evidence.\nThey also claimed neither JS Kabylie, where Ebosse was the top scorer last season, nor the Algerian league had made good on promises after his death to provide financial compensation to the family for their loss.\nThe incident led to JS Kabylie being banned from pan-African competitions for two years and forced to play home league matches in empty stadiums.\nAlso related to this story\n&#39;, u&#34;Print\nEgypt court jails dozens of Islamists over violence\nThe men were accused of involvement in the violence which followed the fall of Mohammed Morsi in 2013\nAbdul Fattah al-Sisi: New face of Egypt&#39;s old guard\nDozens of Egyptian Islamists accused of torching churches and police stations after the ousting of former President Mohammed Morsi have been jailed for up to 15 years.\nProsecutors said the 40 men were involved in attacks which swept through the southern city of Assiut last year.\nThe court acquitted 61 others involved in the case.\nThe Egyptian authorities have jailed more than 16,000 people since last August.\nAt least 1,400 people have also been killed in a wide-ranging crackdown against opponents of the government.\nFollowing the ousting of Mr Morsi in the summer of 2013 there was unrest across the country.\nIn Assiut, several police stations were set alight along with five churches and a number of shops.\nDelivering its verdict the city&#39;s criminal court sentenced two defendants to 15 years in prison, AFP news agency reported, while others were handed jail terms ranging from one year to 10.\nDozens of Mr Morsi&#39;s supporters have been sentenced to death in mass trials over the past year.\nMr Morsi and fellow leaders of the now banned Muslim Brotherhood organisation are also being held in jail or on trial facing the death penalty.\nMore on This Story\n26 MARCH 2014, MIDDLE EAST\nFrom other news sites\nThe battle for guns at university\nMost Popular\n&#34;, u&#39;Women \&#39;could join British infantry by 2016\&#39;\n\&#39;Times have changed\&#39;

universities, about twice as many as in 2011.\nThere was also an increase in universities making unconditional offers to applicants they most want to recruit.\nWide variations\nThis year\&#39;s university admissions figures show a rising tide of more applications, more offers and more accepted places.\nSome 512,400 people secured places in UK universities and colleges through Ucas applications in 2014, up nearly 17,000.  The number of UK students rose 3% to 447,500, and there was a record number of students from outside the UK.\nBut there were wide variations among the UK entrants.\nThe gap between entry rates for rich and poor students has narrowed\nThe Ucas figures suggest women are much more likely to enter university than men. This applies to both rich and poor families and across almost all regions.\nAccording to Ucas, two decades ago there was no gender gap, but this has now become one of the most distinctive features of applications.\nAmong 18-year-olds, the numbers of women going to university is continuing to rise more quickly than their male counterparts.\nIn some constituencies the male entry rates are even lower. In Bristol South only 11% of 18-year-old men go on to university.\nIn contrast there are constituencies where more than half of female school leavers go straight to university.\nUcas says the gender gap in entry rates is the equivalent of 32,000 &#34;missing&#34; male students.\nRegional differences\nWhile the gap between male and female is at its widest ever, the gap between rich and poor is at its lowest.\nRecord numbers of disadvantaged students are getting places in higher education, rising by 11% compared with last year.\nThese students were particularly likely to enter with BTEC qualifications, rather than A-levels.\nFor young applicants in England, 85% were accepted for a university place this year\nBut regional differences remain across the UK. Young people in London and Northern Ireland are the most likely to enter university - those in Wales and the South West of England have the lowest entry rates.\nThere are even lower figures for Scotland, but these are incomplete because Ucas does not cover admissions for all Scottish higher education.\nThere are even wider local differences - with some places having average entry rates below 15% while others are above 50%.\nBuyers\&#39; market\nThe admissions figures also show the growing competition between universities to attract students.\nUniversities are making more offers than ever before, 1.8 million this year, with students with high predicted grades getting four or five offers.\nStudents without A or A* grades at A-level were more likely this year to have got into a selective &#34;higher tariff&#34; university. For students with three B grades, 35% got places into a top-tier university, compared with 32% last year and 17% in 2011.\nAmong students with BBC grades, 15% got places at higher tariff universities, compared with 6% in 2011.\nFor applicants with DDE grades, 12% got into &#34;medium tariff&#34; universities and 58% found a place at a &#34;lower tariff&#34; university.\nAcross all types of university, the Ucas figures show that 85% of 18-year-old applicants from England were accepted for a place somewhere.\nMary Curnock Cook, Ucas chief executive, said the increase in university entrance by disadvantaged students was a &#34;stunning account of social change&#34;.\n&#34;These trends are pushing the difference in entry rates between rich and poor to historic lows,&#34; she said.\nNicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said the rising number of applications represented the end of the volatility that followed the increase in tuition fees.\n&#34;It suggests a return to stability in university applications following the changes and dip in 2012,&#34; she said.\nUniversities Minister Greg Clark said: &#34;For the first time ever over half a million students have entered higher education, with entry rates for students from disadvantaged backgrounds increasing by over 10% to its highest ever levels across the UK.\n&#34;Higher education is a transformational experience and that is why we are the first government to remove the limit on student numbers lifting the cap on aspiration.&#34;\nMore on This Story\n11 SEPTEMBER 2014, EDUCATION &amp; FAMILY\nShare this page\nThe battle for guns at university\nMost Popular\n&#39;, u&#39;Thai tuna firm buys US rival Bumble Bee for $1.5bn\nBumble Bee boasts annual sales of around $1bn\nForced to fish on Thailand\&#39;s trawlers\nThe world\&#39;s largest canned tuna producer Thai Union Frozen Products is buying US rival Bumble Bee Foods for $1.5bn (\u014196m).\nBumble Bee, the largest canned tuna and sardine producer in North America, is currently owned by private equity firm Lion Capital.\nThe purchase is aimed at expanding Thai Union\&#39;s presence overseas and is expected to increase revenues by 25%.\nThai Union said the deal was the biggest acquisition in its history.\nIts chief executive, Thiraphong Chansiri, called the deal &#34;one of the most exciting external growth propositions&#34;.\n&#34;Bumble Bee Seafoods is a leading player in North American shelf-stable seafood; combining the business with Thai Union Group will lower costs, improve efficiency, and create the global leader in the shelf-stable seafood space,&#34; he said in a statement.\nThe Thai firm, which owns the John West and Chicken of the Sea brands, has been on an acquisition spree in the past year.\nEarlier this year, it announced that was buying Norwegian seafood firm King Oscar and French smoked salmon producer MerAlliance for undisclosed sums.\nChris Lischewski, chief executive of Bumble Bee Seafoods said the two firms were &#34;a natural combination given the synergies that exist&#34;.\nBumble Bee boasts annual sales of around $1bn.\nMore on This Story\n23 JANUARY 2014, MAGAZINE\nFrom other news sites\n\xa0\n06:48: Gas prices BBC Radio 4\nProfessor Green says energy suppliers have an eye on politics at the moment.

It is my intention to comply with the decision of the FA and make sure it never happens again.&#34;\nA Liverpool spokesman said: &#34;The club acknowledges the decision reached by the FA independent panel and due consideration will be given to the written judgement once we receive it from the FA.\n&#34;Any further action taken by ourselves in relation to this matter is between the club and player.&#34;\nFormer Manchester City forward Balotelli reposted an image of computer game character Super Mario on Instagram which included the words &#34;jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew.&#34;\nHe later tweeted to deny the post was offensive, before apologising.\nBalotelli returned to the Liverpool squad for Sunday\&#39;s defeat by Manchester United at Old Trafford after six games out with a groin problem.\nBut he was not involved in Wednesday\&#39;s League Cup win at Bournemouth.\nHe has scored two goals in his 15 appearances for the club since signing from AC Milan in the summer.\nAlso related to this story\n&#39;, u&#39;print\nFifa World Cup corruption report: Michael Garcia quitting \&#39;a new low\&#39;\nMichael Garcia\&#39;s decision to resign as Fifa\&#39;s independent ethics investigator is a new low for football\&#39;s governing body, says vice-president Jim Boyce.\nAmerican lawyer Garcia claimed Fifa published an &#34;incomplete and erroneous&#34; report following his two-year study into 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding.\nWhen asked if it was a new low for Fifa, Boyce replied: &#34;I don\&#39;t think there\&#39;s any doubt about that.&#34;\nOn Friday, Fifa members will vote on whether to publish a longer report.\nIn December 2010, it was announced that Russia would host the 2018 World Cup, with Qatar staging international football\&#39;s biggest competition four years later.\nGarcia was asked to file a report into allegations of corruption in the bidding process, however his findings were condensed from an original 430-page report into a 42-page summary.\n&#34;I have always said that as much of this report as is legally possible should be put in the public domain and until that is done it\&#39;s not going to go away,&#34; added Boyce, Britain\&#39;s most senior football official.\nNorthern Ireland\&#39;s Jim Boyce was president of the Irish Football Association for 12 years\n&#34;I will vote that as much as can be legally published should be published. If people have nothing to hide why are they afraid of something being issued?&#34;\nThe vote will be held at a meeting in Marrakesh, Morocco, but it is unclear how many members will be allowed to take part.\nThe Fifa committee consisted of 22 members in December 2010 and president Sepp Blatter has previously said only those people should be able to vote on whether to issue a more comprehensive corruption report.\nHowever, of those original 22, only 13 are still on the committee. It means that 12 members of Fifa\&#39;s committee (which now consists of 25 people), as well as a further two co-opted members, would not be eligible to vote.\nAlso related to this story\n&#39;, u&#39;Sebastian Vettel\&#39;s departure influenced by Ricciardo\&#39;s pace\nBy Andrew Benson Chief F1 writer\nProgramme Details\nBBC Formula 1 Review - Lewis Hamilton: Duel of the Silver Arrows, Saturday 27 December, 13:00 GMT, BBC One\nSebastian Vettel\&#39;s decision to leave Red Bull was influenced by the pace of his team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, team boss Christian Horner says.\nThe German, who won four titles with Red Bull from 2010-14, has joined Ferrari after a year in which Ricciardo won three races and Vettel none.\nHorner says Ricciardo was &#34;probably a factor&#34; in Vettel\&#39;s decision.\nAnd he said the Australian\&#39;s overtake of Vettel at the Italian GP was &#34;quite a defining moment for Sebastian&#34;.\nRicciardo dummied Vettel into the second chicane at Monza, feigning to pass one way before going the other, to beat him to fifth place in the race.\nHorner, speaking in an interview for the BBC F1 review show, said of Vettel: &#34;He was enormously frustrated after that grand prix.\nThe German will drive for Ferrari next season, following in the footsteps of hero Michael Schumacher\n&#34;It was at a time where after the summer break, knowing Sebastian as well as I do, I could see he was very distracted and it was obvious something was at the back of his mind.\n&#34;And I think Ferrari were courting him quite hard and around Spa/Monza was the time he made the decision to do something different next year.&#34;\nHorner said he was &#34;not really&#34; surprised Vettel decided to leave and move to Ferrari as a replacement for Fernando Alonso, who negotiated an early exit from his contract.\nHorner said he believed Vettel had made a final decision on his future between the Italian and Singapore races in September.\n&#34;By the time he got to Singapore you could see he was a different person,&#34; Horner said.\n&#34;He was more relaxed and you could see he had made his mind up, but events had to unfold through Fernando actually leaving Ferrari. So, no, it wasn\&#39;t a great surprise in the end.&#34;\nSebastian Vettel v Daniel Ricciardo\nChampionship position\n3\n3\nVettel has insisted he is &#34;not running away from anything&#34; at Red Bull and that he simply wanted a change of scenery and the chance to drive for Ferrari, where his childhood hero and later friend Michael Schumacher won five world titles.\nVettel will be team-mate there to Kimi Raikkonen in 2015.\nHorner said: &#34;The timing was right for Sebastian. He\&#39;d had a great run with us. He\&#39;d been with Red Bull since 12 years of age.\n&#34;He\&#39;s won four world championships, 39 grands prix, 45 pole positions and I think he felt: \&#39;I\&#39;ve reached 27 years of age. I don\&#39;t want to end my career without having driven for Ferrari and I have a great opportunity to go there.\&#39;\n&#34;The lure of Ferrari for any driver is immensely powerful.&#34;\nVettel feels \&#39;ready for next step\&#39;\nVettel finished fifth in the championship, with Ricciardo third, having been out-scored by 71 points. Ricciardo out-qualified his team-mate 12 times in 19 races.\nHorner said Vettel struggled to adapt to the new cars in F1 this year following the introduction of V6 turbo hybrid engines, reductions in downforce and a fuel restriction.\n&#34;He didn\&#39;t like what F1 had become and was quite vocal about it - didn\&#39;t like the engines, the noise, the way the car felt,&#34; Horner said.\n&#34;He was pretty upset about that at the beginning but once he realised that was it - it wasn\&#39;t going to change - he started to get his head around it. He worked very hard, as he always has.\n&#34;But he got very frustrated the car wasn\&#39;t doing what he wanted it to do and of course to compound that his team-mate is winning a couple of races and performing at the level he was.&#34;\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the new rules in F1 had affected Vettel\&#39;s driving style\nHorner said the banning of exhaust-influenced rear aerodynamics, a technology in which Red Bull had excelled in the previous four seasons, had a big effect on Vettel.\n&#34;The rule changes were significant and the two guys who seem to have been affected most are Seb and Kimi and I think taking away the rear downforce has actually been a big factor for Sebastian,&#34; Horner said.\n&#34;How he generated his lap time was very much using the rear of the car on entry into the slower corners, which was much diminished this year, and that together with the brake-by-wire system had taken away some of the feeling of the braking that he is so dependent on.\n&#34;He is such a \&#39;feel\&#39; driver that some of those feelings had been muted and it dumbed down some of his performance.&#34;\nAlso related to this story\n&#39;, u&#39;Ennio Morricone: \&#39;I regret saying no to Clint Eastwood\&#39;\nEnnio Morricone has received 56 awards for his musical scores\nBjork wins Polar music accolade\nRenowned Italian film composer Ennio Morricone said he regrets saying &#34;no&#34; to Clint Eastwood.\nThe 86-year-old wrote the score to the 1960s trilogy of spaghetti Westerns by Sergio Leone, which saw Eastwood rise to fame.\nBut Morricone said he turned down the chance to write for films Eastwood directed &#34;out of respect&#34; to Leone.\n&#34;I missed a great opportunity and I am really sorry,&#34; he told the BBC\&#39;s arts editor Will Gompertz.\nMorricone, or Maestro, as he is known in his hometown of Rome, added: &#34;When Clint called me, I said no out of respect to Sergio Leone, not because I did not like the movies that he did.&#34;\nAlthough he had first met Sergio Leone when they were at school, it was not until 25 years later that their professional partnership began, on a Fistful of Dollars in 1964.\n&#34;Gradually over time, he as a director and me as a composer, we improved and reached our best, in my opinion, in Once Upon A Time In America,&#34; the composer said.\nEnnio Morricone was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2007 by Clint Eastwood\nThey went on to work together on Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and Leone\&#39;s last credited western, A Fistful of Dynamite (1971).\n&#34;After this relationship with Leone I was able to suggest to other directors how to respond to the music\n&#34;Often directors ask me for pieces lasting 20 seconds and in 20 seconds people do not understand - it is music that is wasted,&#34; he added.\nMorricone, who will resume his European tour next year, said that being a composer is a &#34;difficult profession&#34; and he gets worried by every film he works on.\n&#34;There are ideas that crop up immediately but the majority arrive late.\n&#34;There is no film that has not worried me. I was worried for all of them, it is a difficult profession,&#34; the composer said.\nSome of Morricone\&#39;s most memorable scores include Roland Joffe\&#39;s The Mission (1986), Giuseppe Tornatore\&#39;s Cinema Paradiso (1988), and Quentin Tarantino\&#39;s Kill Bill (2003) and Inglourious Basterds (2009).\nOver the years, the Italian Maestro has received 56 awards, including five Baftas, but missed out on Oscars for Days of Heaven (1979) and The Mission (1986).\nIn 2007, he was awarded an honorary Oscar, presented by Clint Eastwood, for &#34;his magnificent and multifaceted contributions to the art of film music&#34;.\nMorricone wrote the musical scores for some of Leone\&#39;s westerns such as Once Upon a Time in the West\nThe Italian composer said that winning awards is a &#34;celebration of the cinema&#34;.\n&#34;They are great to advertise the cinema, they are important for those who receive them but most of all for the cinema, it is a celebration of the cinema.&#34;\nDespite working in an American-dominated industry, Morricone has never moved to Hollywood, remaining rooted in Rome, where he was born in 1928.\n&#34;I have been tempted. I was invited to live in Hollywood, I said no. I am better here,&#34; he said.\nAfter a year of recovery from a spinal injury, Morricone\&#39;s My Life in Music, World Tour will resume on 1 February 2015 in Amsterdam, stopping in 20 European cities.\nMore on This Story\n11 AUGUST 2011, ENTERTAINMENT &amp; ARTS\nRelated Internet links\n&#39;, u&#34;Virna Lisi, Italian film star, dies aged 78\nVirna Lisi, pictured in 2010, was renowned as a screen beauty and character actress\nItalian screen actress Virna Lisi, famed in the 1960s for appearing opposite stars including Frank Sinatra, has died at the age of 78.\nLisi, feted for her beauty and blonde locks, carved out a successful career in Hollywood, starring in films such as How To Murder Your Wife.\nShe was a force in European cinema, winning best actress at Cannes for 1994 French historical epic La Reine Margot.\nThe last of her movies was made in her native Italy in 2002.\nHowever, Lisi had been due to make a return to the screen in Italian comedy Latin Lover, which is due to be released next year.\nLisi&#39;s love affair with Hollywood ended with a fear that she was being typecast as the dumb blonde, leading her to terminate her contract with Paramount film studios in the late 1960s.\nVirna Lisi&#39;s famous cake-popping moment in How To Murder Your Wife\nThe actress won awards for playing Catherine de Medici in La Reine Margot\nHer role in comedy How To Murder Your Wife, opposite Jack Lemmon, saw her pop out of a wedding cake clad in a bikini in one famous scene.\nLisi also appeared in Assault on a Queen opposite Sinatra in 1966 and performed alongside Tony Curtis in Not With My Wife, You Don&#39;t in the same year.\nShe turned down the role in director Roger Vadim&#39;s classic Barbarella, eventually filled by Jane Fonda, leading to a break from acting during the early 1970s.\nLater on in her career, she was awarded an honorary Italian Golden Globe award in 2004 in recognition of her cinematic achievements.\nThe actress was regularly lauded in her homeland for her work, winning seven David di Donatella awards in the 1980s and 90s, culminating in a special honour in 2009.\nShe had begun her film career as a teenager in the early 1950s with a string of roles in Italian movies.\nLisi is survived by a son, Corrado, and three grandchildren.

And the obsessiveness does suggest that it was probably the work of George III around 1788 or 1789 when he was recovering from his illness.&#34;\nThe handwriting also strongly resembles that of the monarch.\nSecret documents\nMr Clayton believes the plan was a study for the re-development of The White House at Kew, one of a string of royal residences around Richmond and Kew that were built during the 18th Century.\nHe said contemporaries reported that the King spent a good deal of time &#34;drawing plans somewhat manically for rebuilding the house, while recovering from his first serious illness&#34;.\nThe architectural floor plan is part of the King\&#39;s Topographical Collection. He was a keen armchair traveller, fascinated by geography and a passionate collector.  He brought together more than 60,000 maps, views and watercolours from all over the world, particularly Great Britain and the British Empire.\nThere are some of the earliest views of Canada, created on birch bark, and there are the first known watercolours of Sydney to be painted by a professional artist.\nNigel Hawthorne portrayed George III on both screen and stage\nIt also contains a map of New York that was presented to the Duke of York to celebrate the city\&#39;s capture by the English from the Dutch in 1664. It was, according to Peter Barber, &#34;the birth certificate of New York&#34;.\nThe collection also includes highly sensitive and secret government documents for English fortifications around the world, which Mr Barber says should not have been in the King\&#39;s possession.\n&#34;Had they been discovered, England would have been in danger,&#34; he said.\n&#34;They would be sent to him for approval, he would see something interesting and, I think, without asking anybody, he would simply keep them for himself.&#34;\n&#39;, u&#39;Media playback is unsupported on your device\nPeshawar remembers school attack by Taliban\n18 December 2014 Last updated at 19:26 GMT\nPupils who survived a massacre at their school in Pakistan have been paying tribute to those who died.\nAt least 132 children and nine staff were killed when Taliban gunmen stormed the building on Tuesday.\nFergal Keane reports from Peshawar.\nRead more\nBBC \u0160 2014 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

The only common factor was the water.\n\&#39;Harder and harder\&#39;\nIt turned out my sister was suffering from water poisoning, mainly from the water that is pumped into the city from the eastern and western pumping stations.\nWith water purifiers scarce, the stations had been pumping water into the houses through the pipes, without purification or filtration.\nI saw one of our relatives in the hospital - they were also suffering from water poisoning. It dawned on me that the state of the water in the Euphrates that I saw crossing that bridge was the same as when it reached our homes.\nThis was all followed by a sharp rise in the price of bottled water. One of two water bottling factories in the city is closed due to the owner\&#39;s absence, and the other is working with limited capacity - plus roads to Kurdistan, where you can buy bottled water, are all blocked.\nAs we returned home I was agitated thinking about my sister and the whole situation. I know that IS does not care whether our water is filtered or not, so I found myself trying to filter our own water at home mainly by boiling it.\nThis has become another chore to add to the list, as life under the Islamic State becomes harder and harder.\n11 December 2014\nFrom Mays\nOur suffering due to the water shortage has turned into a state of fear that won\&#39;t go away.\nMy husband goes on to the roof every day to see if the water tanks have been filled by the electrical pump from the main water supply.\nWe kept hearing explosions for over three hours\x94\nEnd Quote\nOn one unforgettably terrifying night, I decided to go on to the roof with my husband to help him.\nWe suddenly heard a loud explosion followed by loud voices from the nearby street.\nWe quietly and carefully shifted to peer at the road where we heard the explosion and the voices.\nWe saw a group of Islamic State fighters shooting in the air, and I feared for my husband because they were banging on doors searching for men in the area in order to question them.\nTrembling with fear\nIt turned out that the explosion was caused by a bomb planted on one of the IS vehicles.\nWithin a few seconds the terrifying sound of fighter jets filled the sky, and they starting bombing IS fighters.\nIS vehicles were full of ammunition and we kept hearing explosions for over three hours.\nI was trembling with fear for my husband and my children and dreading the sound of the doorbell. But thankfully the aerial bombardment caused a great deal of confusion among IS fighters, and they didn\&#39;t knock on our door.\nWhen the sun rose we managed to see the extent of the damage to the houses and the street caused by the bombing.\nWe decided to leave our house and stay at a relative\&#39;s place for a few days because I was afraid for my family.\n5 December 2014\nFrom Nizar\nWe have been shocked by the outage of the Asiacell mobile phone network, the main provider in the city. It has left me in a terrible state because, like everyone else, my business depends on communication. In fact, everyone in Mosul depends on it for that matter.\nPeople gather on a hill in Mosul to try to get a mobile phone signal\nA few hours after the network went down, others such as Korek, Zain and Fanous followed.\nIt\&#39;s left the city in a complete void, like we\&#39;ve gone back to the dark ages.\nWe have to rely on people around us and local internet providers for communication.\n\&#39;Not knowing\&#39;\nEverybody was confused by what happened and we were all asking each other, trying to find out when the service would be back. Some blamed the blackout on the government in Baghdad and others on Islamic State - either way, the city is lost.\nThe worst part is there is no real alternative, so if you need to speak to someone you\&#39;d have to go to find them at their home or workplace, assuming they were there in the first place.\nThat happened to me as I was trying to locate a merchant I do business with, who in turn was looking for another person to settle some financial accounts, and I waited and waited, but without success.\nI then returned home to take my sick father to the doctor\&#39;s clinic, also not knowing whether the doctor would be there or not. I was, however, lucky and managed to sort out my family and work affairs - albeit with great difficulty.\nWe don\&#39;t know how long this will last or whether we should start getting used to it as a way of life.\nFrom Faisal\nMy mother called me asking me whether I could buy her a gas canister to replace the one at home as it had run out.\nI took the empty canister and drove to a shop downtown, only to discover that the price for a replacement was more than 60 Iraqi dinars ($50).\nHow can we continue living under this caliphate\x94\nEnd Quote\nI was in complete shock. Before IS took control, the price was barely $7, but with IS it just kept on rising.\nI came back home thinking how would I ever be able to afford it given our tight financial situation. After debating with my mother, we decided it was better if I went back and bought one anyway as life at our home depends on such a necessary item, for cooking, for example.\nForced to shut\nI went back the next morning to discover that its price had gone up to $100 - and there were no canisters for sale in sight!\nI rushed back home in a panic, but decided I\&#39;d better buy some lunch from a restaurant on the way because we didn\&#39;t have fuel to cook.\nThe restaurant was shut. When I asked why, I was told the owner couldn\&#39;t afford the ever-increasing cost of new gas canisters - so he had to shut the whole place down!\nThirteen restaurant employees were laid off - that\&#39;s 13 families who can no longer earn bread, all because of the price of a gas canister. In fact, most restaurants have had to shut, apart from a few which have a stock of gas.\nOthers have resorted to burning wood, using very expensive electric heaters, or stoves that run on oil.\nWe are tired of this situation - there is no clean water, fuel or gas to cook our food.\nHow can we continue living under this caliphate?\nMosul profile\nHow can I use this new currency which is only recognised in IS territory?! \x94\nEnd Quote\nHe said that a group of pious and highly religious men from IS had decided to mint a new gold coin and new coins made of silver and copper in addition to new paper notes which will be used in the markets in the near future.\nHe also said that another group of pious IS youth organised an advertising campaign to announce the use of the new currency.\nThe aim was to make the new Islamic dinar a force to be reckoned with against the US dollar used by the infidels, as the imam said, in what turned out to be the same sermon forced by IS on all the mosques.\nPanic-selling\nI went home feeling worried and confused. I have business and bank accounts and bank dealings with other countries. How can I use this new currency which is only recognised in IS territory?!\nThe IS dinar was going to replace the official Iraqi currency and use of the dollar was going to be banned. I didn\&#39;t know what to do, and I sat with a group of friends to discuss what would happen to our money and to our business.\nEverybody agreed they would exchange the existing Iraqi currency for US dollars or for gold jewellery.\nWe all agreed that the IS plan was not religious or ideological as they said, but merely a scheme to rob us of our money and savings.\nThe next morning a state of chaos gripped the market as everybody was trying to get rid of the Iraqi dinar and to buy dollars or gold.\n21 November 2014\nFrom Faisal\nOnce upon a time in our land, which is rich with water and oil, we used to have a big supply of water and electricity. However, now in the time of the IS caliphate, we lead the most difficult life imaginable.\nWe don\&#39;t have water because the supply station does not work most of the time due to a power shortage.\nWe dug a well to find enough water for our needs\x94\nEnd Quote\nWe collect rainwater in the garden, and my mum tries to save the rain falling on the roof through the gutter in order to use it for the laundry and cleaning.\nWinter came early, and the cold is really harsh. Hot water is one of the most basic requirements of winter in Iraq, but how can we have hot water? We haven\&#39;t had any electricity supply from our national provider for a month or more!\nWe totally rely on private generators. Life would have been impossible in my beloved city without them.\nMy neighbours tried to find a solution to the water shortage, so we dug a well to find enough water for our needs during the continuous shortage of water supply.\nDigging water wells became very prevalent in Mosul, and everybody is digging for water in my country that boasts two major rivers.\nWe now try to save kerosene for heating, although it\&#39;s very scarce and expensive.  The price of a barrel is about $250, although its price on the international markets is no more than $100.\nBut this is not surprising because we live in Iraq, the land of miracles.\n14 November 2014\nThey completely banned the use of colours and coloured pens in school\x94\nEnd Quote\nHe is Egyptian, and his main focus was separating girls from boys in primary schools. According to his instructions, girls go to one building and boys to another. He gave his instructions that girls who look a bit mature for their age should wear loose-fitting garments and a face veil.\nMale teachers are not allowed to teach girls and women teachers are not allowed to teach boys. This decision is very difficult to be implemented by public schools and more so for the private ones.\nPublic schools are funded by the education authority and the ministry of education, and they have a large supply of teachers - male and female - and a lot of buildings.\nPrivate schools, on the other hand, are educational and commercial projects owned by private individuals who do not have the resources to supply the teachers and the buildings.\nThis means that the demand for private schools will decrease in a time when job opportunities are very scarce and money is hard to come by.\n\&#39;They cancelled art\&#39;\nSchool syllabuses have been changes by IS. There are no physical education classes anymore. Instead there is &#34;jihadi education&#34;, which is a subject in which students are taught to love jihad [an Islamic concept meaning &#34;struggle&#34;] and how to do so.\nIS cancelled both geography and history lessons, but then they changed their mind. They cancelled art classes, and instead teach Arabic calligraphy. They completely banned the use of colours and coloured pens in schools.\nAll these matter make the running of schools very difficult, even impossible, especially banning students from activities, such as sports and painting, that mean the world to them.\n5 November 2014\nFrom Nizar\n[Editor\&#39;s note: Before Islamic State overran Mosul, the city was home to one of the oldest Christian communities in the world.

They immediately switch off the lights in the homes they occupy, and some drive off in their stolen cars in some unknown direction.\nThen they return as soon as the air strikes cease. A friend of mine had the nerve to ask one of them: &#34;Why do you run away during the air strikes?&#34;\nThe IS member answered that they fear the strikes will target the houses of Christians that they\&#39;ve occupied because the Christians would have told the coalition their location.\nAnother friend of mine tried to get close to a house occupied by an IS member and his family to see what was happening there, but he was unable to as they never leave the door open, and don\&#39;t even talk in the garden.\nMy friends and I vowed that once this is over, and our city is cleared of the dirt and nastiness, that we would rehabilitate a Christian house to show the world, or at least our Christian friends, that those who did this to them abide by no religion at all.\n24 October 2014\nFrom Faisal\nFour months have passed since Islamic State took over, and a friend of mine is still in hiding here.\nHe worked as a bodyguard for some judges in Mosul, but after the city fell all the judges left and my friend went into hiding. He moved home so no-one would know where to find him.\nTheir criminal acts have terrorised peaceful citizens\x94\nEnd Quote\nMy friend doesn\&#39;t move around in the streets much, because IS fighters are almost everywhere in the city.\nSometimes they set up impromptu checkpoints and go through people\&#39;s IDs, looking for people wanted by IS: former security personnel or judiciary, or anyone suspected of arresting IS members before IS captured the city, or anyone who worked for the governorate or in politics.\nMost of them have left, fearing execution by IS. These kinds of actions have pushed people away from supporting IS. Their criminal acts have terrorised peaceful citizens.\nIS members can be seen executing activists in front of everyone in the streets. They wear black fighter outfits, have let their hair and beards grow - some look as if they haven\&#39;t seen a shower in ages!\nEvery day they increase in number, hold new positions and consolidate their presence, undeterred by the air strikes from coalition forces which do nothing to change things on the ground. It it is actually our reality which has changed and become even more horrific.\nFrom Mays\nI teach at a school in my beloved  city, Mosul. Like other Iraqi mothers I work to provide some sort of financial assistance to my husband, albeit negligible, to help fend off the hardships of life through such hard times and in such an expensive country.\nThis year, when the summer holidays began, I decided to go to Baghdad to visit some family and relatives there and attend a family ceremony.\nAfter the party, when we were all still full of excitement and surrounded by our loved ones, I received news of a curfew back home, and the start of the fighting between government forces and Islamic State rebels.\nFrom that moment I spoke to my husband in Mosul every day to find out the latest news.\n\&#39;Horror and panic\&#39;\nI spent the worst days of my life in Baghdad, the city of my childhood innocence, and where I lived my dreams as a woman in my 20s.

I was constantly wondering what was happening and whether I would ever be with him again.\nAfter the arrival of the Sunni rebels and IS fighters in Mosul, my husband and I started plotting my return to the city, but all roads were still blocked because of the fighting taking place between Baghdad and Mosul.\nCities were falling in hours - not even days - after governmental forces fled or retreated, which left everybody puzzled.\nAfter several attempts by my husband and thanks to some of his connections, we managed to book flights from Baghdad to the north.\nBut then another obstacle faced us - I had not brought my children\&#39;s documentation as I was travelling by land. Yet as we were now flying, it was a must, or we wouldn\&#39;t be able to leave.\nArmed groups\nThanks to good thinking and God\&#39;s will we received the documents via a friend who was leaving Mosul by car and who later flew to Baghdad and brought us the papers.\nI finally got home to my family in Mosul, shortly after midnight on 20 June. I was shocked and frightened by what I saw in the streets, where armed groups were roaming around. I prayed and fasted for three days.\nI stayed at home for a while, until I got used to the situation we are now living under, but those were moments I will never forget.\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Letter from Africa: The culture of sharing the cake\n\xa0\nJoseph Warungu: Gagging order?\nIn our series of letters from African journalists, Nigerian writer and novelist Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at the clamour for assistance that accompanies a politician\&#39;s rise to office.\nThe political party primaries in Nigeria have drawn to a close and voters now have a clearer picture of whose turn it might be to divide up the national cake after the elections in February 2015.\nBut the winning candidates won\&#39;t be the only ones taking their share of the country\&#39;s riches.\nIn Nigeria, news of a person\&#39;s success in an election often travels at the speed of lightning, over rivers and mountains and past fields and forests, to his kindred in all corners of the globe.\nThose with no jobs believe their days of unemployment are coming to an end; those with no education think it will soon pose no barrier to climbing the corporate ladder; those in faraway lands begin plans to return home.\nSoon, these kith and kin launch their pilgrimage towards the successful candidate.\nThey ring his phone; they send text messages; they knock at his gate.\nThey offer to help his campaign in any way they can; they organise prayer sessions for his victory, usually late at night in his living room.\n\x93Start Quote\nThe most unforgivable sin a politician can commit is to forget \&#39;his people\&#39; after he assumes office\x94\nEnd Quote Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani\n\&#39;Bitter tongues will wag\&#39;\nA friend of mine who lives in Lagos told me last week that he was travelling to Benin state.\nHis friend had just &#34;picked up&#34; a spot in the House of Assembly there.

New elections are due in March.\nBut Sweden is still home to an active and at times violent neo-Nazi movement, and there are fears that rising popularity of the Sweden Democrats will also benefit the extremists.\nNazi techniques\nJohan - he asked not to use his real name - was drawn towards the far right as a teenager growing up in a middle-class Stockholm family.\nHis friends split into two groups.

So there is a sense that they are the victims and in that context there\&#39;s not a focus on what they have done.&#34;\nJohan says he does not dwell on the years he spent as a member of the Swedish Resistance Movement now that he has broken away with Exit\&#39;s help.\nHe says he no longer needs the black-and-white certainties that the White Power movement gave him.

Many say the lesson is to keep campuses gun-free, but a growing number of students argue if they were allowed to carry guns at college, they\&#39;d feel safer.\nA former beauty pageant contestant from California, 20-year-old Taylor Woolrich is the first to admit she\&#39;s not your usual guns rights campaigner.\nShe\&#39;s fighting for the right to carry a weapon on campus, for a very personal reason.\nFor years she\&#39;s been stalked by a man she first came into contact with while waitressing at a cafe.\nHe would turn up to see her every day and began to track her down outside work. An emergency restraining order failed to deter him.\nThings became even more terrifying when she moved across the country to study at Dartmouth college in New Hampshire.\n&#34;It wasn\&#39;t even on my mind, and then he contacted me via LinkedIn and used social media to continue to contact me - sent me various very frightening messages, making it very specific he knew where I was,&#34; she says.\nOne summer, when she went home to California, he turned up at her parents\&#39; doorstep. She says police found what they call a &#34;rape kit&#34; - rope tied as a slip-noose, gloves, duct-tape, flash light, and a sweatshirt - inside his car.\nTaylor\&#39;s stalker is currently in jail. His sentence will soon be up.\nTaylor Woolrich is fighting to carry a gun on campus\nHe\&#39;s due to face trial soon on further charges relating to her case. Still, Taylor is desperately frightened that he could be released, or allowed out on bail. She\&#39;s certain that if that happened, he would be able to find her.\nFor that reason, she wants the right to carry a gun on her university premises, arguing it\&#39;s the only way she could overpower him if the pair came face to face.\n&#34;I carry mace, I\&#39;ve considered a Taser, I\&#39;ve considered many options,&#34; she says. &#34;Whatever he\&#39;s going to do, it\&#39;s going to be worse than the possibility of him grabbing my gun and turning it on me.&#34;\nDartmouth College has refused to comment on this specific case due to privacy laws, but says the safety and security of all students is a top priority for them. Any student who reports being stalked is given personalised and heightened protection. On top of this, safety improvements are made, as and when they are needed, says a spokesman.\nYour rights shouldn\&#39;t change once you step inside the campus.\x94\nEnd Quote Crayle Vanest Students For Concealed Carry\nLike the vast number of colleges and universities across the country, Dartmouth has a policy which prohibits handguns on campus.\nThe laws on guns on campuses vary from state to state. In more than half of the country, it\&#39;s up to the universities themselves to decide weapons policy. In New Hampshire, where Dartmouth is located, the decision is left to the college, which chose to keep its campus gun free.\nMany institutions believe that allowing weapons on campus has the potential to inflame tense situations, rather than diffuse them.\nThe American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) has stated, &#34;Even with the best of intentions, armed students or employees could escalate an already explosive situation further, accidentally cause harm or use a gun in a situation that is not warranted.&#34;\nThis month however, a Florida legislator brought forth a bill calling to allow students to carry guns on campus. He cited a recent campus shooting at Florida State University as a reason students need firearms.\nA national group, Students For Concealed Carry, is also calling for the right for students to have a concealed weapon. It would mean they could have a gun in their bag at university, but wouldn\&#39;t be able display it on a holster.\nCrayle Vanest is Midwest regional director for the group. A student at Indiana University, she got her first rifle at the age of 14 for sport, before getting her concealed carry permit.\n&#34;As soon as you walk into the doors of a university you should still be able to carry your gun if you have a licence,&#34; she says.\n&#34;Your rights shouldn\&#39;t change once you step inside the campus.&#34;\nVanest says her organisation has attracted many women.\nLike the vast number of colleges and universities across the US, Dartmouth prohibits handguns on campus.\n&#34;We want to protect ourselves on campus which is an area where women are very frequently victimised.&#34;\nBut just as there are groups advocating for students to carry guns, there are many who call for the opposite, arguing that the presence of weapons exacerbates violence on campus.\n&#34;Having access to guns only increases the chances of an innocent person being hit, versus actually hitting a target or a person who\&#39;s trying to stalk you,&#34; argues Jamira Burley, a member of the Generation Progress, Gun Violence Network.\nBurley also cites the high levels of suicide among college students as another reason for guns to be banned from places of education.

She says the queues have got longer and longer as the price of oil has tumbled.\nEugenia Martinez queues all day to get the products she needs for her family\nMechanic Enrique Moreno says his business is also hit by the scarcity of replacement parts. But in his view, the situation cannot just be blamed on the falling oil prices.\nMr Moreno believes that given Venezuela&#39;s riches the country should be a lot better off than it is, even if the current price per barrel is low.\nMechanic Enrique Moreno thinks mismanagement rather than low oil prices are the problem\nMr Moreno says he can feel a general mood of unhappiness in the streets of Caracas.\nThat mood is reflected by opinion polls which suggest the approval rating for President Nicolas Maduro has been falling along with falling oil prices.\nVenezuela&#39;s generous social programmes are largely financed through oil revenue.\nThe government is reluctant to cut them back - both out of an ideological commitment to the legacy of its late socialist leader, Hugo Chavez, and out of the knowledge that a drastic cut could erode the support of those Venezuelans who voted the government into power.\nWith Venezuela&#39;s credit rating lowered on Thursday by three notches to CCC, the country is getting closer to default.\nAnd with no sign of oil prices rising, the headache for its government of how to counter the drop in revenue looks set to get worse.\nMore on This Story\n10 SEPTEMBER 2014, LATIN AMERICA &amp; CARIBBEAN\nShare this page\nThe battle for guns at university\nMost Popular\n&#34;, u&#34;Print\nIn pictures: Bangladesh oil spill clean-up\nAn oil spill from a crashed tanker in Bangladesh&#39;s Sundarbans waterways is threatening a rare dolphin sanctuary and part of the world&#39;s largest mangrove forest.\nDespite the threat to the environment and people&#39;s livelihoods, some local residents are also finding ways to make money from the clean-up efforts.\nThousands of litres of oil leaked into Sundarbans&#39; waterways following a collision involving a tanker. Much of the surrounding environment is now toxic.\nThe tanker, believed to be carrying 350,000 litres (75,000 gallons) of oil, collided with another vessel on 9 December. It has now been brought to shore.\nThe oil spill covered nearly 40 miles (60km) of waterways. At low tide, oil marks are still clearly visible on the mangrove trees inside the Sundarban Forest.\nThe spill has affected the people who have homes by the Sela River and make a living from the waterways.\nMany people continue to use water from the river for their daily household needs, despite the risks to their health.\nThe Forest Department has engaged local people to help with clean-up efforts.\nVillagers have been scooping oil from the rivers using pots and pans.\nThe people who usually fish in the Sela River are now busy collecting the oil.\nIt has become a source of income for many. Some of the oil is put into drums and sold to a state-owned oil company after it is collected.\nDead plants collected from the forest are also being boiled in an effort to extract some oil for sale.\nIt can be a lucrative business. For some, collection of oil has become more profitable than fishing.\nCargo vessels are forced to wait on Pashur River while the clean-up is under way.\nThe Sundarbans area contains part of the world&#39;s largest mangrove forest.

But in the Hungarian capital Budapest, &#34;escape room games&#34; are luring in tourists and locals alike. So what\&#39;s the appeal?\nIf I\&#39;m honest I can\&#39;t make head nor tail of the drawing in front of me. It looks like a plumbing diagram.\nAnd while it\&#39;s clear that the sequence of noises - a church bell ringing, a frog croaking, a cat mewling - are code for something, I am none the wiser.\nI\&#39;m in a dimly lit cellar, furnished with creaking chairs, broken toys, and old computer monitors. The low-arched brick ceilings have been whitewashed, but there are few other concessions to civilisation.\nPeeling paint and low lighting add to the atmosphere\nBut sometimes it\&#39;s hard to tell what is a clue and what is just part of the sinister decor\nContinue reading the main story\n\x93Start Quote\nThere is a theory that because we were closed off from the rest of the world we turned towards games\x94\nEnd Quote Zoltan Kovacs Founder of Trap\nWith time pressure mounting it\&#39;s vital that my team and I piece together some kind of logic among the junk, if we want to make an escape. That\&#39;s the challenge. Identify each puzzle in the room, unravel its mystery in turn and you may get out before your allotted hour is up.\nBut still ringing in my ears are the words of owner Attila Gyurkovics before he locked us in: &#34;Getting out is not guaranteed.&#34;\nHidden objects\nParapark was Budapest\&#39;s first escape room game, based on the timeless truth that everyone relishes a challenge.\nFor just over 8,000 forints (\u014120) a team of up to five people has 60 minutes of complete distraction from the real world above. And despite Attila\&#39;s ominous tone there is no real price to pay, except frustration, if he has to unlock the door for you in the end.\nAfter wrestling with puzzle pieces, a broken doll and intermittent blackouts we\&#39;re eventually free and Attila, a former social worker, tells me how the idea for Parapark occurred to him just over three years ago.\nAttila Gyurkovics came up with the escape game three years ago\n&#34;I was playing computer games - hidden object games - with my girlfriend,&#34; he says.\nHe noticed how absorbing they were, how despite their artifice, he was so swept along he stopped noticing the time passing.\n&#34;After a while I thought, \&#39;That\&#39;s what we have to do in real life.\&#39;&#34;\nFaded grandeur\nSince Parapark opened its doors in 2011, Hungarians have taken the concept and run with it.\nIn Budapest it is estimated there are now about 60 different escape games.\nThe themes are pleasingly varied, including joining Alice down the rabbit hole, racing to defuse a suitcase bomb and being trapped in a psychiatric ward.\nThere\&#39;s one obvious reason why Budapest is the crucible for this burst of creativity.\nMany Budapest properties are in need of renovation\nThe streets are lined with majestic Habsburg era townhouses. But their grandeur is fading. Chunks of plaster lie in the gutters and broken windows indicate empty properties, even in the city centre.\nThe financial crisis knocked the wind out of Hungary\&#39;s property market and you can rent an apartment for just a few hundred dollars a month. A cellar costs even less.\nTomb raiders\n&#34;The truth is conditions are ideal here for this game, as if these cellars were made for this,&#34; admits Zoltan Kovacs, who runs Trap, another escape game company in Budapest.\n&#34;The premises are so cheap. It\&#39;s easy to get a permit. Everything is suitable for making easy money. It\&#39;s tempting to try it.&#34;\nIn some ways it\&#39;s too tempting. The main worry for established businesses like Zoltan\&#39;s is the explosion of new games, some of which have been thrown together quickly and cheaply to cash in on the craze.\nTrap\&#39;s games are more elaborate than most. The props and puzzles are purpose built from glass, wood and metal, while a sophisticated network of electronic triggers opens up secret passages and new challenges. It takes his team six months and around \u01418,000 to develop a new game.\nZoltan Kovacs is taking the idea of exit games into businesses and schools\nAs we\&#39;re talking a team of foreign students arrives.\nOne room here is furnished like a medieval castle complete with gallows, an axe and a treasure chest.\nBut the group is eager to pit their wits in the other game: the ancient Egyptian tomb.\nPuzzle masters\nSo just how smart do you have to be to solve the puzzles? Zoltan claims no specialist knowledge is required beyond secondary school level.\nHe left school as soon as he could and says if he can solve a puzzle it\&#39;s not too difficult.\nBut he did pass his leaving exam, and it\&#39;s worth noting that Hungary\&#39;s traditional education system expects students to be proficient in geography, physics and arithmetic.\nMoreover Hungary is famous for producing both world-class chess players, and a high number of Nobel Prize winners in maths and science. Houdini was born in Hungary.\nIs it possible that Hungarians have a special affinity for these kinds of brainteasers?\n&#34;Under communism we were forced to be creative and resourceful,&#34; says Zoltan.\n&#34;There is a theory that because we were closed off from the rest of the world we turned towards games. This is why Erno Rubik invented his cube. We had nothing else left.&#34;\nNo specialist knowledge required, just a logical mind\nTeamwork is key\nBut that doesn\&#39;t prevent moments of individual frustration\n\&#39;Like reality\&#39;\nThe rest of the world is taking to Hungary\&#39;s games now too.\nCopies have begun to spring up in other European cities, almost all offshoots or franchises of Hungarian ones.\nTrap is expanding to offer corporate team-building, a mobile game, and versions to use in schools. Zoltan\&#39;s eyes light up as he describes his idea for a game based on 19th Century inventors such as James Watt and Thomas Edison.\nFinally the team of students appears through the exit. They have done rather well, locating secret panels, deciphering hieroglyphs and confronting mummified heads.\nAnd despite the effort, they\&#39;ve enjoyed the experience.\n&#34;It\&#39;s really realistic. That\&#39;s what makes it special,&#34; says Manuel from Germany.\n&#34;You\&#39;re really trapped in a room... sometimes when you\&#39;re into it, it doesn\&#39;t feel like a game. It feels like reality somehow.&#34;\n&#34;You have to try it - because it\&#39;s Budapest,&#34; says his French teammate Francois. He shrugs. &#34;Just try it.&#34;\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#34;Viewpoint: Obama secures legacy with Cuba policy shift\nBy Michael Shifter President of Inter-American Dialogue\nThe policy changes lift restrictions on Cuba in place for more than five decades\nAmerica&#39;s man in Havana\nWith the speech outlining a major shift in US-Cuban relations, President Barack Obama secured his legacy in Latin America.\nThis was the speech most Latin Americans were hoping to hear from a US president for decades - and one many believed they would hear shortly after Obama came to office in 2009.\nIt took a lame duck session, a president unburdened by concerns about Florida politics, and a worsening economic situation in Cuba to produce the long-awaited change.\nTo be sure, Obama had already moved in 2009 to lift the restrictions on travel and remittances of Cuban Americans that had been imposed by the George W Bush administration in 2004.\nAlthough those measures were welcome and had some effect, they were mainly on the margins and did not represent any fundamental shift towards engagement.\nBut on Wednesday Obama sounded a lot like the advocates for policy change on Cuba.\nUS President Barack Obama announced sweeping changes to US-Cuba policy on Wednesday\nHe did not just call for punishing Cuba less than before, but rather to end efforts to isolate Cuba diplomatically and squeeze it economically.\nObama made it clear that he is now committed to reversing course and opening up with Cuba in a meaningful way. That means pursuing expanded trade, communication and cooperation.\nAlthough he still has to work within the legislatively mandated embargo, Obama has ample latitude and can build political momentum towards ending the anachronistic policy.\nTo realise the full potential of the new measures will, however, require some changes in Havana as well.\nIf the new US-Cuba policies will get the political backing in Washington they need to be sustained and succeed, there will have to be some indication that Cuba is taking steps towards greater political opening.\nA look back at the relationship between the two countries through the decades\nIf the regime cracks down, hardliners in the US Congress will have more ammunition to push back.\nThe new measures will test the long-held view that the Cuban leadership actually wants and needs the punitive US embargo to justify its absolute political control.\nRemoving that gift to the regime, the argument goes, will undercut its legitimacy and open things up.\nWhile that view may well have been largely plausible when Fidel Castro was in charge, it is less persuasive in the current moment and under his younger brother Raul\xb4s direction.\nRaul Castro has presided over a series of measures of economic opening, including reduction of state employment and the spread of private businesses, but these have moved slowly and have had a number of difficulties, frustrating many Cubans.\nVenezuelan President Hugo Chavez has supported Cuba financially\nAlthough one can never be certain, having been in Havana over the last week there is a sense that, out of sheer economic necessity, the Raul Castro government would like to see more open and productive economic relations with the United States.\nThe Cuban economy is in dire straits and requires infusions of capital that will be hard to attain without significant US engagement.\nCuba&#39;s already severe problems have recently been aggravated by Venezuela&#39;s unrelenting economic crisis, made much worse by falling oil prices. Cuba has been heavily dependent on Venezuelan largess since Hugo Chavez came to power in 1999.\nIt is unclear, of course, whether the Obama administration&#39;s new measures will contribute to greater political opening and improvements in human rights in Cuba.\nBut few can argue seriously that the punitive approach, in place for over half a century, helped much on that score. Obama the empiricist believes that if a policy doesn&#39;t work it is time to try something else.\nNo policy, foreign or domestic, better fits that dictum. Also judging by the reaction on the streets of Havana, most Cubans too are relieved that the US-Cuba deadlock is over and could - though not easily or quickly - unleash some positive changes in their country.\nWashington&#39;s absurd Cuba policy has long stood in the way of a more constructive relationship with Latin America.  No issue has been such a powerful unifying factor across the region.\nCuban President Raul Castro discussed the sweeping changes to US policy with Mr Obama prior to their announcement\nThis bold move will not eliminate the growing distance between the United States and Latin America, but it is likely to help reduce the distance and open up opportunities for deeper engagement on a range of other issues.\nWhen Obama attends the Summit of the Americas in Panama next April, and meets with his counterparts including Raul Castro, he is expected to be greeted with great warmth and enthusiasm.\nObama may discover that, as he looks across the global geopolitical landscape, with religious wars flaring, he may have more time for Latin America in his remaining two years in office.\nMore on This Story\nThe battle for guns at university\nMost Popular\n&#34;, u&#39;Putin\&#39;s news conference: Five things we learned\nBy Bridget Kendall Diplomatic correspondent, BBC News\nPresident Putin reassured Russians that they would weather the difficulties\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has been speaking at his end-of-year news conference.\nOver the course of three hours, he discussed the economy, Ukraine, the opposition - and his love life.\nHere are five things we learnt.\nBelt-tightening ahead\nRussians are paying more for imported goods because of the plunging rouble\nJudging by Mr Putin\&#39;s forecast, Russians can expect the current rocky ride to continue: the collapse in oil prices and plummeting rouble are due to &#34;external factors&#34; which may go on for two years.\nBut the vulnerable will be looked after: food prices and pensions will be protected. And big spending plans to upgrade Russia\&#39;s armed forces, invest in infrastructure and prepare for the 2018 World Cup in Russia will be shaved, not shelved.\nAnyway, if a cheaper rouble means more expensive imports that is to be welcomed, in Mr Putin\&#39;s view. He believes the only way Russia can grow stronger and safer is to rely less on foreigners and more on itself.\n&#34;Only a strong Russian state can protect the interests of Russian citizens,&#34; he said, after telling a cautionary tale of an offshore Russian company whose money was blocked because of Western sanctions.\nFor jittery markets, there were two concrete takeaways. First, a reassurance that it would not be right to take the drastic step of imposing planning capital controls - at least not yet.\nSecond, the news that a prominent Russian oligarch has been released from house arrest and may even be granted a presidential audience.\nVladimir Yevtushenkov\&#39;s arrest on charges of alleged money laundering a few months ago sent shivers through Russia\&#39;s business elite, who feared it might be a harbinger of more to come.\nThe threat from without: Bear-baiting\nAs usual, Mr Putin appeared to extend some olive branches, claiming he wanted to work with the West on issues of mutual concern, and insisting Russia stood ready to mediate in the Ukraine crisis.\nBut elsewhere there was no spirit of compromise or conciliation, or any sign of the radical change in Russia\&#39;s outlook which the EU foreign policy chief has just appealed for.\nOn Ukraine: &#34;We are right and you are wrong,&#34; he said, accusing the West of backing an illegal coup and explaining away the conflict in the south-east as Kiev\&#39;s &#34;punitive&#34; onslaught on its own citizens.\nPresident Putin says the West is once again trying to rein in the Russian bear\nAnd Russia\&#39;s involvement? Yes, there were some volunteer soldiers, but they were &#34;not mercenaries - they aren\&#39;t being paid&#34;. Also, any trucks contained humanitarian aid.\nMore importantly, in the last two months Mr Putin and his top officials have begun to argue that this crisis is not really about Crimea and Ukraine at all. Really, he now says, this is an age-old campaign by hostile Western powers intent on weakening and containing a Russian foe.\nAny new &#34;walls&#34; being erected in Europe are due to Nato\&#39;s expansion, not Russian aggression. The West, he claims, has always wanted to &#34;chain the bear&#34; and &#34;defang it and pull out its claws&#34;.\nHe even insinuated that Russia\&#39;s war with Chechnya in the 1990s may have been partly fuelled - on the Chechen side - by outside help from the West.\nThe threat from within: Invisible traitors\nAs for Russia\&#39;s internal politics, he was twice asked where he drew the line between  a &#34;fifth column&#34; of traitors whom he says he will not tolerate, and a legitimate political opposition.\nMr Putin repeatedly said it was a delicate matter and a difficult line to draw - hardly reassuring for those worried about where they stand.\nHe added that it came down to what his critics thought. Were they Russian patriots who held their country dear, or were they acting on the orders of another government whose interests were alien to Russia\&#39;s?\nHe doesn\&#39;t know what he earns\nThe Kremlin is well-defended, says Mr Putin\nSome of the Russian questions were surprisingly sharp and challenging:\nWas the economic pain Russia was enduring now the cost it had to bear for taking Crimea?\nDid Mr Putin know that some in his entourage privately blamed him for Russia\&#39;s problems, so was he afraid of a palace coup? The answer: &#34;No, because we have no palaces and the Kremlin is well defended.&#34;\nAnd was it not his own cronies, those who reaped high salaries from controlling state enterprises or the main TV channels who were really the enemies of Russia?\nMr Putin calmly replied that Igor Sechin, who runs Russia\&#39;s biggest state oil company, was an efficient manager and he had no idea what he earned. As an afterthought the Russian President added that he did not know what his own salary was either.\nAs usual at this annual extravanganza, many regional journalists waved placards, like peasants petitioning their tsar. One woman, from a car magazine, brought along a green woolly crocodile to make her point.\nAnother man, with slurred speech, called for Russians to drink less foreign Coca-Cola and more domestic kvas, a Russian honey drink. Mr Putin agreed with him, and joked that the questioner had already had enough - though it later emerged he was not drunk but had suffered from a stroke.\nPutin and love\nProbably the Russian public will best remember the woman from Voronezh who said her aunt wanted to know if he, Russia\&#39;s top bachelor, was still single. Mr Putin\&#39;s reply: &#34;Say hi to your aunt and tell her all is well.&#34;\nHe added that he had told another friend that he was no monster but loved someone and was loved in return - and maintained good relations with his ex-wife.\nMr Putin knows how to please the crowds. He throws in a few personal details to signal that he is as human as anyone else, and - even at this time of crisis - he is relaxed enough to enjoy banter with the audience in between the reassurances that Russia will weather its difficulties.\nMore on This Story\nThe battle for guns at university\nMost Popular\n&#39;, u&#39;Luxembourg speaks for the Dutch\nBy Laurence Peter BBC News\nXavier Bettel says he is now satisfied that Luxembourg is not being unfairly targeted over tax\nJuncker denies tax break allegations\nIt\&#39;s not often that a country of half a million gets to represent a nation of 16 million.\nLuxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel pointed that out light-heartedly, as he stood in for the Netherlands at an EU summit in Brussels.\nHis Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte is embroiled in a coalition dispute over healthcare legislation.\nSo Mr Bettel came here not long after Mr Rutte had phoned him to make the request.\nIt is all the more surprising because Luxembourg is in the EU spotlight over its controversial tax sweeteners for huge corporations like Amazon and Microsoft.\nWhy was Luxembourg chosen, rather than Belgium, to represent the Netherlands?\n&#34;Because I\&#39;m older [than the Belgian PM] and I\&#39;ve been in the European Council longer,&#34; Mr Bettel told journalists.\n&#34;For me it\&#39;s a question of trust - you know how closely in the Benelux we work together.&#34;\nDutch PM Mark Rutte faces trouble at home over healthcare reform\nInevitably the hot topic of tax arrangements came up.\nHe said Luxembourg had dropped its appeals to the European Court of Justice over a European Commission request for information on Luxembourg tax rulings and the Grand Duchy\&#39;s patent box scheme, which deals with intellectual property taxes.\nThe Commission had initiated an infringement procedure against Luxembourg.\nBut Mr Bettel said he was now satisfied that Luxembourg was not being singled out, because soon all 28 EU states would have to divulge tax information to the Commission.\n&#34;We always said fishing [for information] was not the right way to work - we insisted on a level playing field, so the rules are the same for everyone.&#34;\nSo Luxembourg defused the court dispute.

The move to grant bail to Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi yesterday has taken this saga to another level,&#34; official spokesman in the external affairs ministry Syed Akbaruddin said.\n&#34;We have, therefore, forthwith communicated to Pakistan through diplomatic channels our strong concerns on this matter and the sentiments across the spectrum of Indian society that that this will make a mockery of Pakistan\&#39;s commitment to fight terror groups without hesitation and without making distinctions,&#34; the spokesman said.\n\&#39;Pak will continue to export terror\&#39;\nLakhvi\&#39;s bail came a day after India expressed full solidarity with Pakistan in the aftermath of the Peshawar massacre, and the court order led New Delhi to react strongly against the bail. The court said the charge-sheet against Lakhvi and other accused was flawed and lacking in evidence. The prosecutor did not say whether the government would appeal in a higher court against the court\&#39;s bail order.\nSources said the Federal Investigation Agency, which had provided solid evidence to the court about LeT\&#39;s involvement in the Mumbai attacks, disagreed with the bail but had to accept anti-terrorism court judge Kausar Abbas Zaidi\&#39;s order.\nThe court directed Lakhvi, a trusted lieutenant of Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, to pay surety bonds worth Rs 5,00,000 ($5,000) before his release. Advocate Rizwan Abbasi had filed the bail application of the seven accused a day earlier, when lawyers across the country were on strike over the school carnage.\n&#34;We were not expecting this decision as we were still to produce a good number of witnesses in the case. We are awaiting the court\&#39;s detailed order before giving further comment on the decision,&#34; said chief prosecutor Chaudhry Azhar. Lakhvi\&#39;s counsel Raja Rizwan Abbasi told agencies that the court had granted bail as &#34;evidence against Lakhvi was deficient&#34;.\nAfter Lakhvi\&#39;s release on bail, we should stop pleading with Pak and follow policy of Israel in ensuring retribution to terrorists.\n&#39;, u&#39;The Times of India\nYou are here: Home \xa0\u0165\xa0India\nBreaking News:\nThree detained in Jabalpur for following Mehdi\&#39;s twitter handle\nTNN | Dec 19, 2014, 09.21 AM IST\nMy Saved articles\nRELATED\nBHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh counter-terrorist group and anti-terrorist squad detained three youths, who followed and interacted with ISIS propaganda on twitter account @ShamiWitness run by Mehdi Masroor Biswas.\nThe trio, picked up from Jabalpur district\&#39;s Rampur Patel mohalla on Wednesday night, was among 17,700 followers of Mehdi\&#39;s twitter handle, intelligence sources told TOI.\nThough Jabalpur police is tight-lipped on detentions from the region, sources in the state\&#39;s intelligence unit said suspects re-tweeted sensitive posts from the pro-ISIS account operated by Biswas, who was arrested by Bengaluru police last week on charges of waging war against India.\nIP address of at least 50 \&#39;objectionable\&#39; emails on Biswas\&#39;s id was tracked to computers in Jabalpur by Bengaluru police, who contacted their MP counterparts for investigations, sources said.

Rather, it will have a far reaching impact on the agricultural economy of the whole state. The chronic shortage of water for drinking and agricultural purposes in the Rayalaseema region could be addressed permanently once the Polavaram project gets commissioned. This is the next priority of the TDP government,&#34; said Naidu. The TDLP also discussed the issue of helping those BPL families who have not received any benefit from the government so far. With many members wanting the government to identify such families, Naidu assured them that he would do so and ensure the benefits reach them.

Sources said the committee, comprising B Sambob, Ajay Kallam, and D Sambasiva Rao, did not even hold a meeting after its visit to Vijayawada in October. The panel had visited a few places, in cluding private engineering colleges on the outskirts of the city. In the meantime, the government posted Sambasiva Rao as the TTD executive officer.\nThough Chandrababu Naidu had visited Medha IT towers near Gannavaram airport four months ago and found it fit for location of important offices, the state government has not de-notified the IT SEZ to enable utilization of the building for government offices.

Responding to this, information and public relations minister Palle Raghunatha Reddy said it would be possible to rename Hindupur as NTR district after the reorganization of the districts. &#34;There is a proposal to increase the number of districts in Andhra Pradesh.

I just put that down to the fact that he\&#39;d only just been elected and so I suspect that a lot of people didn\&#39;t really know very much about him, and his own nationals were probably still in the phase of him having won the election.&#34;\nOther than these leaders, the survey also featured Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and South African President Jacob Zuma.\nThe survey questioned people from 30 countries, including 12 from Asia, four each from Africa and the Americas, eight from Europe and two from Oceania \x97 Australia and New Zealand.\n&#39;, u&#39;The Times of India\nYou are here: Home \xa0\u0165\xa0India\nBreaking News:\nRape-accused hurls grenade at police party in Kupwara, constable injured\nM Saleem Pandit M Saleem Pandit,TNN | Dec 19, 2014, 04.42 AM IST\nREAD MORE Pampore police | Aungmatipora\nRELATED\nSRINAGAR: Amidst rising incidents of crime in the Kashmir valley, a rape accused tried to resist arrest by throwing a hand grenade at a police party on Thursday in Bumhana in Kupwara district.\nMohammad Rasheed Bhat, Superintendent of Police (SP) Kupwara said an FIR had been lodged against Ghulam Qadir Dar, resident of Bumhama for rape.\n&#34;The Kupwara sessions court today asked the SHO Kupwara to execute the court order related to the case,&#34; Rasheed said.

His family members were also out of town that night.\nThe home department, headed by Gogoi himself, started an inquiry immediately and prima facie found security lapses, a source said. Gogoi has a ZPlus security cover under which NSG commandos protect him only during his movements and at his office at the state secretariat. At home, a close protection team (CPT) and a house projection team (HPT) comprising personnel from the state police look after his security.\nThe Assam Police headquarters on Thursday afternoon removed DIG (security) KK Sarma and replaced him with DIG AJ Baruah. The two SPs \x97 B Kalita and D Deka \x97 have been replaced by additional SP (Sonitpur) NT Sawakare and additional SP (Cachar) Rajveer. Both these IPS officers are scheduled to be promoted to the rank of SP on January 1.\nOn Sunday, after hosting a lunch for his cabinet colleagues and party leaders to felicitate newly appointed Pradesh Congress Committee president Anjan Dutta, Gogoi retired to his official residence in the eastern corner of the city atop the highly fortified hill.\nA source said that at 12.15 am, a sub-inspector made a last round and left the CM\&#39;s residence after confirming that the CM had gone off to sleep without any health complaints. About 40 minutes later, at 12.50 am, the chief minister woke up feeling uneasy and started vomiting.\nThe source said the chief minister walked out of his bedroom into the adjacent office room and wanted to call the security personnel who were supposed to be posted just outside the door of the office room. However, he could not find anyone and picked up the intercom to call for help. Even the phone wasn\&#39;t working, the source said.\nLuckily, the security man who was missing from his post showed up and raised an alarm. One of the ASPs, Montu Thakuria, reached the CM\&#39;s residence at 1.10 am followed by another ASP S Nath, 10 minutes later. The resident doctor was also by his side with medicines.

These will bring the battery-operated vehicles under the act and fresh applicants can straightaway get learners\&#39; licence to drive such vehicles carrying four passengers.\nThe bill was passed amid several questions raised by some of the members about the passenger safety aspects of these vehicles and poor quality parts imported from China.\nThough several opposition MPs claimed that the amendments were brought only because of the upcoming Delhi assembly election, road transport minister rejected the contention saying delaying the changes would harm over 2 lakh poor whose livelihood is dependent on these vehicles. He added no safety issue has been compromised.\nNow, the bill will be introduced in the Rajya Sabha for passage where again there is little chance that it would be blocked by any political party. If even then a stalemate arises in the Upper House, the government can bring an ordinance since it has already been passed by Lok Sabha, sources said.\nGadkari said, &#34;This is an amendment bill. If we pass the bill, I will incorporate rules and regulations suggested by you,&#34; in response to members who demanded that the bill be sent to standing committee for a closer scrutiny. He added that early passage of the bill will be a boon for one crore underprivileged people who face a lot of health problems by plying cycle rickshaws manually.\nSeveral members raised safety concerns and the danger posed by substandard vehicle parts from China. Congress MP Ranjeet Ranjan was more forthcoming when she said that she had her children rode an e-rickshaw. &#34;How many of us have travelled in an e-rickshaw. I took and so my children. But I decided never to use them....This vehicle can overturn if it hits a one feet stone or at a pothole. It\&#39;s very risky,&#34; she said.\nWhile welcoming the &#34;smart e-rickshaws&#34; TDP member Ram Mohan Naidu said though the amendments are being made keeping in mind the one lakh e-rickshaw owners, &#34;But we have to see that with the one lakh e-rickshaws, there will be at least four people traveling in that. We should also consider the safety of these four lakh people and the safety of the people who are on the roads, when they are put on the road. How much are we compromising on safety?&#34;\nHe added the new licencing regime will make it easier for drivers but the key question is how much safety standards is being compromised. &#34;Holding a drivers licence is not just learning to drive the vehicle. They also know the rules of the road. That has to be taken care of,&#34; the young MP said.\nGadkari said while safety issues have been taken care of, at present there is no import of Chinese parts for these vehicles.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Ram Mohan Naidu,Lok Sabha,Gadkari,e-rickshaw,Central Motor Vehicle Act\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

The government is working on fallback options including issuing an ordinance.\nThe government came close to achieving a breakthrough on Thursday when Congress leader Anand Sharma came close to initiating the stalled discussion on conversions.

When O\&#39;Brien refused to begin, sticking the demand that the PM must address the House, the chair tossed the ball to Sharma.\nThe Government is understood to have pointed out that the PM\&#39;s intervention on minister of state for food procession Niranjan Jyoti\&#39;s abusive remarks against minorities did not lead to order being restored in the upper House.\nUnsure whether the current heated confrontation with Trinamool in the backdrop of the CBI arrests in the Sarada case will allow the proper functioning of the Rajya Sabha, the government is looking to see if parties like NCP, Congress, SP and BSP are open to a middle ground.\nThough the government has decided to continue waging a war of nerves with the Opposition, a series of &#34;Hindutva-related&#34; controversies have given non-NDA parties a common ground that has been missing since the Lok Sabha election.\nThe Sangh Parivar\&#39;s &#34;anti-minority&#34; agenda and controversies like &#34;ghar vapasi&#34; have provided useful ammunition to parties like Trinamool to stall the government in the upper House where it lacks a majority.\nWhile the PM has spoke in party meetings about the need for BJP MPs to avoid raking up issues other than those related to governance and development, he is understood to be reluctant to address the subject as a &#34;pre-condition&#34; to a discussion.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Narendra Modi,insurance bill\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

The cabinet also decided that Sundays will no longer be dry days though working hours of bars will be reduced marginally.\nChief minister Oommen Chandy said the government has decided to bring in the amendments following the report submitted by the tourism and labour secretaries who studied the impact of the new policy in their respective sectors.\n&#34;It has been decided to bring down the working hours of bars from 15 hours a day to 12.30 hours. The timing of bars will be decided by the excise department based on this. The decision to lift dry days on Sundays has been taken following the report that the sale of liquor in Bevco outlets has increased by 60% on Saturdays. Apart from this the tourism industry was also severely affected by this decision,\&#39;\&#39; Chandy said.\nThe bars which were functioning till March 31 this year, and which meet basic hygiene requirements, will be eligible to start beer and wine parlours. This decision has been taken to help employees in these bars who became jobless after the government decision.\nIn the cabinet meeting, IUML leaders protested against the amendments, but Chandy sought to brush it away, saying, &#34;The IUML has always stood for total prohibition and they have difference of opinion with the UDF policy on this.&#34;\nWhen asked whether new beer and wine parlour licenses will be issued, the CM said, &#34;The UDF did not take any decision for not giving fresh licenses.\&#39;\&#39; The cabinet also decided to maintain status quo on club licences.\nOn shifting of Bevco outlets along the national and state highways as per the high court order, the cabinet decided to close down 10% of the outlets on January 1, 2015. &#34;There are 163 outlets along the national and state highways and it is not feasible to shift them. Hence it has been decided to close down these outlets in phases,&#34; Chandy said.\nThe cabinet also decided to continue with the 5% cess imposed on liquor which will be utilised for rehabilitation of bar employees.\nThe new amendments will be operational once orders are issued by the excise department. An expert committee will be constituted to study the impact of the new liquor policy in the state.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Oommen Chandy,Kerala\x92s liquor policy,Bevco Outlets\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

According to state finance minister Amit Mitra, the aggregate revenue loss would be Rs 8,200 crore in the first year. The amount is almost 20% of the states own revenue generation of Rs 40,000 crore and 29% of the debt repayment of Rs 28,000 crore. The capital repayment out of this is Rs 9,000 crore which would be almost equal to revenue loss.\nAlarmed at the haste of the Narendra Modi government that seems set to table the Bill in Parliament this session, state finance minister Amit Mitra has written to the chairman of the empowered committee of finance ministers A.R. Rather demanding an urgent discussion on the Constitution Amendment Bill.\nGST is proposed as a destination based tax with tax revenues going to the consuming states. The states that consume more will be getting more tax, while producing states that export goods to other states will be apparently on the losing side. Producing states such as Bengal, Maharashtra have to tread with caution.\nAlarmed at the haste of the Narendra Modi government that seems set to table the Bill in Parliament this session, the state finance minister has written to the chairman of the empowered committee A.R. Rather demanding an urgent discussion on the Constitution Amendment Bill.\nMitra took exception to the Centre\&#39;s bid to push through the Bill without consulting the majority states when the Bill in its present form infringes upon the state\&#39;s autonomy to tax certain items at its own rates and also keep certain items namely crude petroleum, diesel, aviation turbine fuel and natural gas outside the GST net.\nThe draft Bill includes petrol and petroleum products under the GST net when the Mamata Banerjee government had strongly objected against inclusion of these in the last meeting of the empowered committee meeting held on December 11. With most of the goods and services coming under the GST, the Bill also proposes to do away with the state\&#39;s power to levy tax on select items \x97 &#34;declared goods&#34; as provided under Article 286 of the Constitution.\nWhat\&#39;s more is the finance minister had urged to retain the state\&#39;s higher tax rate on tobacco and tobacco products. Accordingly, a meeting of the empowered committee of the finance ministers was called on December 11 to discuss the amendments to the draft Bill submitted by the states. Later, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley was present in the meeting of the empowered committee. As many as 29 states supported Bengal\&#39;s cause and the majority opposed the draft Bill in its present form, Mitra claimed.\nThe Union finance then told the committee to form a sub group for further discussion. Accordingly a sub group was formed with Gujarat, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka without any representation from eastern states.\nThe sub-group discussed the Bill later without circulating it to the state finance ministers and the draft Bill got the Cabinet nod. &#34;I have written a letter to Arun Jaitley on December 15 pointing to this fact. He asked me to meet him. But the chairman of the empowered committee A R Rather, the finance minister of J&amp;K;, later told me that it will discussed in the committee before submission to cabinet. However, to our surprise we heard that it is tabled in the cabinet undermining the Empowered Committee and the federal structure,&#34; he added.\nElaborating the tax implications, Mitra pointed out that if the petrol and petroleum products is subsumed in GST then the state may loose up to Rs 2,350 crore. It may be noted that petroleum products and tobacco are considerable revenue earner to this debt ridden state.\nThis apart, sales tax on diesel in Bengal is 17% while that is on motor spirit (petrol) is 25%. There is a cess of Rs 1 as well on both diesel and MS along with some advalorem surcharges. The total revenue from of the state from this account is Rs 3,000 crore now. Besides, petrol and tobacco, the new draft of GST also proposed to subsume entry tax and CST is out of the divisible pool.\nAccording to Mitra, in entry tax account the state would loose between Rs 1,200 crore and Rs 1,500 crore while in tobacco the loss will be Rs 350 crore. &#34;The major blow will be CST. Now the total due of the state on this account is Rs 78,000 crore and our due is Rs 4,500 crore from 2010. The centre is now offering only Rs 11,000 crore from this account to the states where we shall get only Rs 400 crore. The perpetual loss every year from this account would be Rs 2,600 crore which will be applicable from the second year of GST rolled out,&#34; the minister said. However, the Constitutional Bill has to be passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by a two-third majority.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Narendra Modi government,GST,Goods and Services Tax,Amit Mitra\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

This was challenged by her in the HC, which had refused bail to her while admitting her appeal.\nThe SC had granted bail to Jayalalithaa on October 17.

But your PIL had already been filed,&#34; the bench told petitioner Rakesh U Upadhyay, an advocate.\nThe PIL claimed that as many as 3,146 farmers in Maharashtra have already committed suicide unable to bear the financial crisis caused by a grim drought situation in Vidharbha and Marathwada regions, where crops have failed repeatedly.\nUpadhyay said on average four farmers were committing suicide every day and this year the total figure has so far reached 1,022. He said nothing had been done by the Centre and state government to solve the problem and no strategy is in place to provide immediately relief to the farmers.\n&#34;The small and marginal farmers are subjected to a vicious circle by private money lenders who take benefit of impractical governmental policies,&#34; the petitioner said requesting the court\&#39;s intervention.\n&#34;The higher cost of Bt cotton seeds forced farmers to take loan from private money lenders who charge exorbitant interest rate of about 60% per year. These money lenders compel farmers to sell their cotton to them at a price much lesser than the market price,&#34; he said.\nHe said even when there was no drought and there was a good yield, the poor marginal farmers continued to suffer as the benefits of good crop was grabbed by the money lenders and middle men.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Supreme Court,Chief Justice H L Dattu\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

Not only did he enjoy the luxury of regular &#34;outings&#34; from prison to visit his family and friends, he was treated like a VVIP within the confines of the high-security prison and had a smooth traffic of visitors, most of them terror commanders seeking his guidance and advice.\nLakhvi, who had monitored the carnage from the LeT control room in Karachi and given blow-by-blow instructions to the 26/11 Mumbai attackers, was at one time using five different cellphones inside the jail to communicate with LeT commanders and cadres. According to intelligence sources, he made calls freely to keep tab on the outfit\&#39;s operations and gave pep-talks to his terror associates.\nAccording to a former Union home secretary, Lakhvi\&#39;s detention in Adiala Jail is even better than a house arrest. While a person under house arrest cannot leave the premises of his detention or receive any visitors unless authorized by the detaining authority, Lakhvi was allowed to use vehicles and security to meet his family and terror associates outside the jail premises.\nLakhvi is known to have even fathered a child during incarceration, thanks to these &#34;outings&#34;. Abu Jundal, the 26/11 handler who was deported to India in 2012, had told his interrogators here that Lakhvi, during one of their meetings in Adiala Jail, had informed him that the prison authorities had allowed his wife to visit him in prison in 2010 to perform conjugal rights, following which their son was born.\nAccording to intelligence updates submitted to the government over a period of time, Lakhvi\&#39;s &#34;cell&#34; in Adiala Jail is a well-appointed suite with all modern facilities, including a television set. He has access to newspapers and moves within the jail without any restrictions. &#34;He is kept in good humour by the jailors and prison staff, under what the security agencies believe are standing instructions from Pakistani state agencies like the ISI,&#34; a senior intelligence officer told TOI.\nIn fact, the jail authorities even arranged a birthday celebration for their most-coveted prisoner in 2012.\nAgencies here believe that Lakhvi was arrested as Pakistan was under pressure from the Western nations. The arrest was meant to &#34;showcase&#34; Pakistan\&#39;s commitment to bring 26/11 perpetrators to book, while secretly ensuring that he was not isolated from his family or his \&#39;work\&#39; as a terror commander.\nPakistan has turned down repeated requests from Indian agencies for Lakhvi\&#39;s voice samples, stating that its laws do not allow samples to be taken without the consent of the accused.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi,Rawalpindi\x92s Adiala jail\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

Isn\&#39;t it simple to say that we will reach 50% first, or the metros, cities, and then the talukas? Why do we say 100% first, and then fail on it, and thereafter recriminate?&#34; Khullar said at a seminar \&#39;India - Broadband For All\&#39; organised by Ericsson and COAI. &#34;It is an impossible target, (and) you are bound to fail&#34;.\nThe Modi government plans to link village panchayats across the country by December 2016 through the national optical fibre network (NOFN). The idea is to provide broadband access to all through the programme, while promoting initiatives like e-governance, e-education and e-health.\nKhullar said that a focus just on building optic fibre infrastructure &#34;is wrong&#34;, but rather the government needs to focus on developing applications based on the requirements in the rural areas. He said that there is a need to engage state governments to work out local solutions and applications. &#34;Can you tell of any application that does this?&#34;\nKhullar said other stakeholders should also be roped in to make the project viable. &#34;Unless you can co-opt state governments, universities, hospitals, it will only be on paper. You can take it from me. It is not about (optic fibre) pipes, but about delivering outcomes.&#34;\nFEATURED ARTICLES\n&#39;, u&#39;The Times of India\nYou are here: Home \xa0\u0165\xa0 Business \xa0\u0165\xa0India Business\nBreaking News:\nSign in to earn your Badges\nModerator\nFind and flag inappropriate comments on Timesofindia.com by marking them offensive.

The DGCA action comes after the home ministry withdrew the mandatory security clearance to Jindal\&#39;s aircraft charter firm, said sources. No aviation company can operate without this clearance.\nJSPL\&#39;s charter firm was given licence on December 23, 2008. According to the DGCA website, it has a luxury 13-seater Global Express (VT-JSB) and a nine-seater Cessna 560XL (VT-JSS). The Global Express had come under DGCA scanner earlier this year during the general election campaign period when a number of charter aircraft were checked and some even grounded, including those of the Reliance and Adani Group.\nThis March, the Jindal Global Express was checked at Delhi airport and many lapses were reportedly found in it. This plane was checked along with Reliance\&#39;s Falcon 9X \x97 a high end luxury jet \x97 that is used mainly by Kokilaben Ambani, Mukesh and Anil\&#39;s mother. While the Reliance plane was grounded for a day, Jindal\&#39;s Global Express escaped that punishment. If the firm\&#39;s NSOP is cancelled, it may not take to the skies in a hurry.\nA JSPL spokesperson said: &#34;JSPL has applied for the renewal in timely manner as provided by the law and has also followed it up in the regular course of business. We have just received a show-cause notice from DGCA on Tuesday, why our NSOP licence should not be withdrawn due to non-grant of security clearance. However, reasons for the non grant of security clearance have not been mentioned in the DGCA letter. Immediately, the next day, we replied to the show-cause notice asking DGCA, the detials of the reasons so that we can explain why NSOP licence deserves to be renewed. We are confident that there is no reason for the non renewal of NSOP. We await DGCA\&#39;s response for our further necessary action and are also exploring our legal options.&#34;\nFEATURED ARTICLES\n&#39;, u&#39;The Times of India\nYou are here: Home \xa0\u0165\xa0 Business \xa0\u0165\xa0India Business\nBreaking News:\nSign in to earn your Badges\nModerator\nFind and flag inappropriate comments on Timesofindia.com by marking them offensive.

Troubles at Kalanithi Maran-owned low cost carrier (LCC) started from mid-November when leasers started repossessing aircraft, leading to reduction of flights. As SpiceJet\&#39;s slashed its schedule, passengers of its cancelled flights made a beeline for other carriers \x97 mainly IndiGo and Jet.\nAccording to directorate general of civil aviation ( DGCA ) data, market shares of IndiGo and Jet shot up from October (when SpiceJet was flying its entire fleet) to November (see graph). Wadia Group\&#39;s GoAir also gained and carried more flyers.\nState-owned Air India, which is being kept alive by pumping in thousands of crores of tax-payers\&#39; money, could not capitalize on the situation. It actually saw its market share drop by two percentage points from October to November. AI (domestic) even pipped SpiceJet in terms of numbers of passengers being affected by flight cancellations. As many as 4,242 AI passengers had seen their flights cancelled, while the figure for SpiceJet was 3,290. And, 27,200 AI (domestic) flyers faced delays of over two hours. &#34;The focus may be on SpiceJet but AI should be the real worry for the government,&#34; said an official.\nMeanwhile on Thursday, sources said SpiceJet operated over 140 flights by evening and had six cancellations by then \x97 out of its truncated schedule of 230 daily flights. Oil companies have put SpiceJet on cash-and-carry and the LCC is paying cash to get fuel.\nFull service carriers, Jet and AI, are now planning to fill in the void created by SpiceJet\&#39;s flight reduction. They are both planning to deploy wide body aircraft on domestic routes. AI has three Boeing 777-200 (long range) which it will lease out by next summer. It plans to utilize these three twin aisle planes on domestic sector till then.\nJet on Thursday introduced 12 additional daily flights on domestic routes. It will deploy wide body Airbus A-330 on routes like Delhi-Bengaluru-Delhi and Delhi-Chennai-Delhi from next Tuesday to January 29, 2015.\nFEATURED ARTICLES\n&#39;, u&#39;The Times of India\nYou are here: Home \xa0\u0165\xa0 Business \xa0\u0165\xa0India Business\nBreaking News:\nSign in to earn your Badges\nModerator\nFind and flag inappropriate comments on Timesofindia.com by marking them offensive.

The appointment comes at a time when the Narendra Modi government is trying to sell a 10 per cent stake in the company and break its near-monopoly by allowing private firms to mine and sell coal.\nThe officials did not want to be named before an announcement, which may come as soon as this week, but said the meeting is to discuss a detailed plan to raise output to 1 billion tonnes.\nUnder Bhattacharya, Singareni, majority owned by the state of Telangana, has been able to easily beat its production targets, unlike Coal India that has not met its target for the past several years.\nDisruptions by worker unions, a lack of adequate railway lines and less use of machines have dragged Coal India&#39;s output. Its unions have threatened to go on a five-day strike starting Jan. 6, opposing the divestment plan and opening up of the industry for the first time in 42 years.\nFEATURED ARTICLES\n&#34;, u&#39;The Times of India\nYou are here: Home \xa0\u0165\xa0 Business \xa0\u0165\xa0India Business\nBreaking News:\nSign in to earn your Badges\nModerator\nFind and flag inappropriate comments on Timesofindia.com by marking them offensive.

The latest policy statement has clearly given indication if the price behaviour is along the trajectory envisage ... I expect probably changes will come in the early part of next year. It could be any time.\n&#34;But the only factor that has to be taken into account at the present moment is the fact that there is great volatility in the foreign currency markets.

The flows will remain a key factor in the near-term for markets.\nThe partially convertible rupee ended at 63.11/12 per dollar versus its Wednesday\&#39;s close of 63.6150/6250. It had touched 63.89 in the previous session, its weakest level since Nov. 13, 2013.\nOn the day, the rupee gained 0.8%, its biggest single-day gain since a similar rise seen on May 16 when election results gave the Bharatiya Janata Party a full mandate.\nFed chairman Janet Yellen told a news conference that &#34;patient&#34; meant the US central bank was unlikely to hike rates for &#34;at least a couple of meetings,&#34; meaning April of next year at the earliest.\nThe benchmark 10-year bond yield ended down 4 basis points on the day at 7.93%. The yield rose to 8.03% on Wednesday, its highest level since Dec. 1.\nIn the overnight indexed swaps market, the benchmark 5-year swap rate dropped 6 basis points to 7.28%, while the 1-year rate fell 7 basis points to 7.85%.\nMeanwhile, shares gained 1.6 % on hopes of tax reforms and underpinned by the global rally.\nFEATURED ARTICLES\n&#39;, u&#34;The Times of India\nYou are here: Home \xa0\u0165\xa0 Business \xa0\u0165\xa0India Business\nBreaking News:\nSign in to earn your Badges\nModerator\nFind and flag inappropriate comments on Timesofindia.com by marking them offensive.

(Reuters photo)\nRELATED\nWASHINGTON: The US Secret Service needs an outsider to overhaul the insular agency, beef up staffing and improve training \x97 after building a higher fence around the White House, an independent review concluded on Thursday.\nAn executive summary of the highly classified review revealed deep problems at the top of the Secret Service, which is charged with guarding the US president and other senior government officials.\n&#34;The panel heard one common critique from those inside and outside the Service: The Service is too insular,&#34; the published summary said.\nHomeland security secretary Jeh Johnson appointed a four-member independent panel in October after a Sept. 19 intrusion by an Iraq war veteran who scaled the White House fence, sprinted across the lawn and got deep inside the mansion before an off-duty agent stopped him.\nThat incident prompted the panel\&#39;s first recommendation: build a better fence &#34;as soon as possible.&#34; It recommended one that is at least 4 or 5 feet (120 or 150cm) higher and curves outward at the top to give agents more time to assess the risk of a jumper.\nBut the agency\&#39;s problems, it noted, &#34;go deeper than a new fence can fix.&#34;\nA director not tied to agency traditions and personal relationships will be better equipped to do an honest reassessment and encourage a culture of accountability.\nThe last Secret Service director, Julia Pierson, was a 30-year veteran who was tasked with cleaning up the agency\&#39;s culture after a 2012 presidential trip to Colombia in which up to a dozen agents were found to have hired prostitutes.\nPierson resigned under fierce criticism on Oct 1, less than two weeks after the Sept. 19 White House intrusion. That fence jumper breach came a day after the disclosure that an armed private security contractor rode on an elevator with Obama in Atlanta in a breach of protocol earlier in September.\nThe security lapses, along with a 2011 incident in which seven gunshots were fired at the White House, had raised concerns across Washington that Obama was not as well protected as he should be in an age of global tumult.\nThe panel said special agents and uniformed division personnel work an &#34;unsustainable number of hours.&#34;\n&#34;The Secret Service is stretched to and, in many cases, beyond its limits,&#34; the panel said.

(AP Photo)\nRELATED\nWASHINGTON: He was, in many ways, a perfect spy \x97 a man so important to Cuba\&#39;s intelligence apparatus that the information he gave to the Central Intelligence Agency paid dividends long after Cuban authorities arrested him and threw him in prison for nearly two decades.\nRolando Sarraff Trujillo has now been released from prison and flown out of Cuba as part of the swap for three Cuban spies imprisoned in the United States that President Obama announced Wednesday.\nMr Obama did not give Mr Sarraff\&#39;s name, but several current and former American officials identified him and discussed some of the information he gave to the CIA while burrowed deep inside Cuba\&#39;s Directorate of Intelligence.\nMr Sarraff\&#39;s story is a chapter in a spy vs. spy drama between the United States and Cuba that played on long after the end of the Cold War and years after Cuba ceased to be a serious threat to the United States. The story \x97 at this point \x97 remains just a sketchy outline, with Mr Sarraff hidden from public view and his work for the CIA still classified.\nThe spy games between the two countries lost their urgency after the fall of the Soviet Union, but the spies have stuck to their roles for more than two decades: pilfering documents, breaking codes and enticing government officials to betray their countries. &#34;There were a number of people in the Cuban government who were valuable to the U.S., just as there were a number of people in the U.S. government who were helpful to the Cubans,&#34; said Jerry Komisar, who ran C.I.A. clandestine operations in Cuba during the 1990s.\nWith Wednesday\&#39;s exchange of imprisoned spies and the leaders of the United States and Cuba talking in a substantive way for the first time in more than 50 years, some people who were part of the spy games between the two countries now wonder just how much it was worth it.\nIn retrospect, Mr Komisar said, there was little need for American intelligence services to devote so much attention to Cuba \x97 a country with a decrepit military that he said posed no strategic threat to the United States since the Soviet Union pulled its missiles off the island in 1962.\nAfter decades of cloak-and-dagger activities between the two countries, he said, it turned out to be &#34;a draw.&#34;\n&#34;You have to ask yourself, \&#39;To what end?\&#39; &#34; he said.\nBefore he was arrested in November 1995, Mr Sarraff worked in the cryptology section of Cuba\&#39;s Directorate of Intelligence and was an expert on the codes used by Cuban spies in the United States to communicate with Havana. According to members of his family, he had studied journalism at the University of Havana and had the rank of first lieutenant at the intelligence directorate.\nIt is not clear when Mr Sarraff, now 51, began working for the CIA Chris Simmons, who was the chief of a Cuban counterintelligence unit for the Defense Intelligence Agency from 1996 to 2004, said that he worked with another man \x97 Jose Cohen, one of Mr Sarraff\&#39;s childhood friends \x97 to pass encryption information to the C.I.A. that led to the arrest of a number of Cuban agents operating in the United States.\nMr Simmons said that Cuba\&#39;s spy service regularly communicated with its agents in America using encrypted messages sent over shortwave radio. After Mr Sarraff helped the United States crack the codes, he said, the FBI was able to arrest Cuban spies years after Mr Sarraff was discovered and put in prison in Cuba.\n&#34;When Roly was providing information, he was giving us insights about where there were weaknesses in the Cuban encryption system,&#34; Mr Simmons said.\nCuban authorities arrested Mr Sarraff in November 1995 and put him on trial for espionage, revealing state secrets and other acts against state security. According to one senior American official, the Cuban government learned of his plans to defect when he was on assignment in a third country and recalled him to Cuba and put him in jail.\nAccording to members of Mr Sarraff\&#39;s family, he went to work one day in 1995 and never came home. Cuban officials told the family for more than a week that Mr Sarraff was on a job in the country\&#39;s interior and would be back soon.\nHe was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Mr Simmons, the former D.I.A. officer, said he believed that the reason Mr Sarraff was not executed was because his parents were officials in the Cuban government. &#34;He has always maintained his innocence&#34; his sister, Vilma Sarraff, said by telephone from Spain. She said that Mr Sarraff\&#39;s daughter was 7 when he was arrested.\nMr Cohen escaped Cuba on a raft and was sentenced to death in absentia. He now lives in Miami and works as an Amway salesman. In an interview on Thursday, he insisted that neither he nor Mr Sarraff ever sold information. &#34;What I did I did because I admired the values of this country, and because what was happening in Cuba was a farce,&#34; he said.\nMr Cohen declined to offer any details about the espionage, saying it was too dangerous to discuss the case without direct proof that Mr Sarraff had left Cuba. He said that the Cuban government never had any hard evidence to present against Mr Sarraff and said his friend\&#39;s case was politically motivated.\n&#34;They sentenced me to death and then sentenced him to 25 years to serve as a lesson for everybody else,&#34; he said.\nIn his speech Wednesday, Mr Obama referred to Mr Sarraff as &#34;one of the most important intelligence agents that the United States has ever had in Cuba,&#34; someone who &#34;provided America with the information that allowed us to arrest the network of Cuban agents that included the men transferred to Cuba today, as well as other spies in the United States.&#34;\nHours later, the office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a statement saying the information from Mr Sarraff \x97 the statement did not name him \x97 had helped the government arrest and convict several Cuban spies inside the United States. The convictions included a senior analyst at the Defense Intelligence Agency named Ana Belen Montes; a former Department of State official, Walter Kendall Myers, and his wife, Gwendolyn Myers; and members of the Red Avispa network, or Wasp Network, in Florida.\nMultiple news accounts in recent years have identified Mr Sarraff as a former Cuban intelligence officer who had been imprisoned. The accounts named him as a possible candidate to be released if the United States and Cuba were ever to agree to a spy swap.\nSome people here said this Trujillo is a &#34;patriot&#34;? No, patriots are people who fight (or &#34;spy&#34;) for their countries not for the enemy. The...\nI am shocked that we would reward Cuba with an embassy when they treat their prisoners so horrifically. On the other hand we can...\nWhat is the next trade? Tsarnaev for Snowden? This dangerous stuff trading criminals for criminals.\nBut Ms. Sarraff said that if her brother had in fact collaborated with American intelligence agencies to help snare Cuban agents living in the United States, it was certainly not something he ever discussed with his family.\n&#34;If what they are saying is true, fine, he paid that debt with 20 years in prison,&#34; she said.\nMs. Sarraff said her brother was in solitary confinement for 18 years. An avid painter and poet, he was not permitted any painting supplies or other distractions. He was also denied parole, Ms. Sarraff said.\nShe said that her brother had been calling his family regularly from prison, but that they had not heard from him in several days. She said her family had been told Mr Sarraff had been released from prison, but had not heard directly that he was part of a prisoner exchange.\nShe said she had no idea where he was.\n&#34;They did not say where they had taken him,&#34; she said, becoming irate.\n&#34;How is it possible that they take my brother out of the country without telling his parents? My parents are at the point where my father is likely to have a heart attack!&#34;\nSpeaking by phone from Havana, Mr Sarraff\&#39;s father, also named Rolando, said &#34;this is not a moment of happiness \x97 it\&#39;s panic.&#34;\n&#34;I have gone three days without knowing the whereabouts of my son,&#34; he said. He confirmed that his son had once worked for Cuba\&#39;s intelligence service.\nAs Mr Sarraff\&#39;s family and friends wait to hear from him, his former partner in espionage said Mr Sarraff gave up his freedom for a cause he believed in.\n&#34;Here\&#39;s what I can tell you about Roly: He is a person who loves liberty. He was jailed unjustly,&#34; Mr Cohen said.\n&#34;He sacrificed his life. When he gets here, he will tell his story.&#34;\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Rolando Sarraff Trujillo,Cuban spies,Cuban authorities,CIA Chris Simmons,CIA\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

On the way into court, one of the victims angrily showed his artificial leg to demonstrators proclaiming the suspect\&#39;s innocence.\nDressed in a black sweater and gray pants, a skinny 21-year-old Tsarnaev with unruly curls sat between two female lawyers in the packed court room to hear preparations for his January 5 trial.\nHe answered questions from Judge George O\&#39;Toole calmly and quietly in the brief session that lasted less than half an hour.\n&#34;Very much so,&#34; he said when asked if he was satisfied with his representation.\nTsarnaev is accused of carrying out the attacks with his brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a shootout with police, and faces the death penalty.\nHe pleads not guilty to 30 charges. The attacks plunged Boston\&#39;s world-famous marathon into mourning and revived fears of terrorism in the United States more than a decade after the al-Qaida hijackings.\nThursday\&#39;s hearing was the first time he has been seen in public since entering his not guilty plea in July 2013.\nAt the time he was suffering from injuries from his time on the run. On Thursday he seemed in good health.\nAt the end, Elena Teyer, whose son-in-law Ibragim Todashev was shot dead by an FBI agent while being questioned in May 2013 about his friendship with Tamerlan, cried out in Russian.\n&#34;You have a lot of supporters. We all pray for you, we all know you\&#39;re innocent,&#34; she said. &#34;Stop killing innocent people!&#34; she added in English before being forced out.\nFamilies of the victims, with drawn faces, were separated from the rest of the public in the gallery.\nMarc Fucarile, who lost a leg in the attacks, walked into court with the help of a cane.\n&#34;That\&#39;s trickery?&#34; he demanded, showing his artificial leg to two demonstrators who held up placards questioning the FBI investigation.\nThe charges against Tsarnaev include conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and bombing a public place resulting in death.\nHe and Tamerlan are accused of planting two pressure cooker bombs hidden in backpacks near the finish line of the marathon.\nHe is also charged in connection with the shooting death of a campus police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the brothers\&#39; wild overnight getaway attempt.\nInitially scheduled for November 3, his trial is now due to begin on January 5 with jury selection, which could take several weeks.\nThe trial itself could take two to three months.\nTsarnaev is being held at Fort Devens prison hospital, home to 1,095 prisoners, around 44 miles (70 kilometers) from the Boston court.\nHis lawyers say he is held largely in isolation and subject to tight restrictions imposed by attorney general Eric Holder in August 2013.\nA Muslim of part-Chechen descent, Tsarnaev emigrated with his family to the United States in 2002 and became a naturalized American citizen in 2012.\nHe allegedly scrawled a rambling explanation of his motives for the Boston attacks on an interior wall of the boat, where he was arrested in a suburban backyard several days after the attacks.\n&#34;The US government is killing our innocent civilians,&#34; Tsarnaev wrote. &#34;I can\&#39;t stand to see such evil go unpunished ... we Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.\n&#34;Now, I don\&#39;t like killing innocent people, it is forbidden in Islam, but ... stop killing our innocent people and we will stop.&#34;\nHe moved to Boston from Dagestan with his family at the age of eight and is said to be profoundly affected by his background and early childhood in Kyrgyzstan.\nProsecutors say the brothers, who appear to have acted alone, prepared bombs based on instructions in al-Qaida\&#39;s English-language magazine &#34;Inspire.&#34;\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,Boston Marathon bomber\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

The authority claimed that he was unable to perform his duties, for example, needing the help of a colleague to tie a child\&#39;s shoe-laces.\nLegal experts had said that if Kaltoft who weighed more than 158 kg won the case, obesity would need to be approached just like any other physical or mental impairment, preventing an employer from treating an employee less favourably because of their weight. This would include the ability to dismiss.\nThe court said that no provision of the Treaties or of secondary EU legislation prohibits discrimination on grounds of obesity as such. In particular, the Employment Equality Directive does not cite obesity as a ground for discrimination.\nAs for whether obesity can constitute a \&#39;disability\&#39; within the meaning of the directive, the court observed that the purpose of the directive is to lay down a general framework for combating discrimination, in the area of employment and occupation, on any of the grounds referred to in the directive, which include disability.\nIt said &#34;The concept of \&#39;disability\&#39; within the meaning of the directive must be understood as referring to a limitation which results in particular from long-term physical, mental or psychological impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder the full and effective participation of the person concerned in professional life on an equal basis with other workers.&#34;\nFurthermore, the court observed that &#34;employers must take in each particular case so as to enable a person with a disability to have access to, participate in, or advance in employment (unless such measures result in a disproportionate burden being imposed on the employer).&#34;\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

(Reuters photo)\nRELATED\nWASHINGTON/LOS ANGELES: The US government on Thursday said it was weighing the proportional response to the sophisticated perpetrator of a cyberattack that crippled Sony Pictures, exposed its executives and led to the cancellation of the film &#34;The Interview.&#34;\nSpokesman Josh Earnest said the White House is not in a position to confirm that North Korea is responsible for the hack at Sony, after a US official said Wednesday that Washington may soon formally announce the involvement of the Pyongyang government. The effect of any response, such as cyber retaliation or financial sanctions, could be limited, US experts said.\nMore than three weeks after the attack by hackers identifying themselves as &#34;Guardians of Peace&#34; brought down the computer network at Sony Pictures Entertainment, one of Hollywood\&#39;s biggest studios grappled with the losses to its operation and reputation through sensitive leaked emails.\nSony decided on Wednesday to scrap its big Christmas Day release of &#34;The Interview,&#34; a comic film that culminates in the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Movie theater chains said they would not show the film citing security concerns after hackers made threats against cinemas and audiences.\nA senior North Korean UN diplomat declined to comment on accusations that Pyongyang was responsible for the hacking attack on Sony Pictures. He also declined to comment on the delay of the release of the film.\nAfter the cancellation, Sony began pulling promotion of the $44 million film, dismantling the giant promotional billboard on Hollywood\&#39;s famed Sunset Boulevard on Thursday.\nSome of the Hollywood\&#39;s biggest names howled over the cancellation of the film starring James Franco and Seth Rogen, the latter also a co-director on the movie with partner Evan Goldberg.\nSteve Carell, who has starred alongside Rogen in numerous comedies, said &#34;Sad day for creative expression.&#34;\nThe hacking could hit Carell more directly. A film project called &#34;Pyongyang,&#34; a paranoid thriller starring the actor that was to be set in North Korea, was scrapped by producer New Regency, Deadline.com reported.\nNeither Rogen nor Goldberg would comment on Thursday on the fate of their film amid grassroots efforts like screenings and petitions to keep the movie alive and honor the filmmakers.\nSCREENINGS CANCELLED\nThree movie houses called off special screenings of 2004 Paramount Pictures puppet-comedy &#34;Team America: World Police&#34; in which a US paramilitary force tries to foil a plot by then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, father of Kim Jong Un.\nThe Alamo Drafthouse in Texas scrapped the screening because of &#34;circumstances beyond our control,&#34; while the Ohio-based Capitol Theatre and the Plaza in Atlanta said their screenings were canceled by Paramount.\nRepresentatives for Paramount were not immediately available to comment.\nSony said Wednesday it has no further plans to release &#34;The Interview,&#34; but that has not stopped speculation that another company or maybe even Sony itself would aim for a smaller distribution some time in the future.\nSony\&#39;s embattled executives continued efforts to undo damage to their reputation wrought by the leaking of sensitive emails hacked in the November attack.\nCivil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton met Thursday with Sony Pictures Co-Chairman Amy Pascal to discuss racially insensitive emails from her, included joking remarks related to US President Barack Obama and his taste in movies.\nBut Sharpton stopped short of asking for her resignation.\n&#34;The jury is still out on where we go with Amy,&#34; Sharpton said. &#34;We\&#39;re not going to be satisfied until we see something concrete done.&#34;\nIt was still unclear what the costs to Sony Pictures would be for cancelling &#34;The Interview&#34; and for the cyberattack.\nAny losses will undermine Sony Corp\&#39;s goal to boost results at the film studio as the money-losing conglomerate undergoes a restructuring and tries to counter flagging smartphone sales. Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai told investors in November that he aimed to lift its movie entertainment revenues by more than a third in the next three years.\nWhile Rogen last week praised Pascal for having the courage to make the film, the long-time executive might be in a fight to keep her job because of that decision.\n&#34;If you look at some of the emails, you have to go back and research, and look at her discussions with the head of Sony overall in Japan, they never wanted to make this movie in the first place,&#34; Mike Paul, crisis management consultant and president of Reputation Doctor LLC, told Reuters Insider.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=sony hack\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

Stinney Jr\&#39;s father had been part of the search team that found the girls\&#39; bodies hours later in a ditch, badly beaten with crushing blows to their skulls.\nStinney Jr had been arrested and executed within the space of around three months. Executioners noted that he was too small for the electric chair when he died; the straps did not fit him, an electrode was too big for his leg, and the boy had to sit on a bible to fit properly in the chair.\nHis case has long been spoken of as an example of how a black person could be railroaded by a justice system during the era of Jim Crow segregation laws where the investigators, prosecutors and juries where all white.\nThe boy\&#39;s family have insisted that he was innocent, and in January they asked a local judge to order a re-trial and clear Stinney Jr\&#39;s name, claiming there was new evidence about the crime.\nAime Ruffner receives support from family and friends after testifying at the hearing to reopen the case for her brother George Stinney Jr. in Sumter, South Carolina.\nThis time Stinney Jr\&#39;s case was given a two day hearing in which experts questioned his confession and the autopsy findings, while the judge heard accounts from the boy\&#39;s surviving brothers and sisters, and someone who had been involved in the search. Most of the evidence from the original trial was gone and almost all the witnesses were dead.\nIt took Mullen nearly four times as long to return her decision on Stinney Jr\&#39;s case than it had originally taken to arrest and have him executed in 1944, and said in her ruling that she could &#34;think of no greater injustice&#34; than the boy\&#39;s case.\nDefense witness Katherine Stinney-Robinson leaves the stand after her testimony at the hearing to reopen the case for her brother George Stinney Jr. in Sumter, South Carolina.\nJudge Mullen found that Stinney Jr\&#39;s confession was &#34;highly likely&#34; to have been coerced by authorities, while few or no witnesses were found to have testified in the trial.\nThe judge said she was overturning the boy\&#39;s conviction because the South Carolina court had failed to grant a fair trial in 1944.\nAdditional reporting by AP\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

European cruise ships may no longer call at ports in the Crimean peninsula, except in an emergency.\nThe measure applies to all ships owned or controlled by a European or flying the flag of an EU member state. Existing cruise contracts may be still be honoured until March 20.\nThe 28-nation EU has previously banned the import of goods from Crimea and barred new investment in infrastructure projects in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors and investing in oil and gas ventures.\nThe annexation of Crimea gave Russia rich oil and gas resources in the Black Sea, depriving Ukraine of energy resources.

(AFP Photo)\nRELATED\nSYDNEY: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Thursday admitted Sydney\&#39;s cafe siege was &#34;a horrific wake-up call&#34; as details emerged of the final minutes of the standoff which left the gunman and two hostages dead.\nAbbott has ordered an urgent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the tragedy and why deranged self-styled Islamic cleric Man Haron Monis was not under surveillance given his history of extremism and violence.\nThe Iranian-born 50-year-old was on bail for a string of charges, including sexual offences and abetting the murder of his ex-wife.\n&#34;This has been a horrific wake-up call,&#34; Abbott told Macquarie Radio when asked if this was an incident waiting to happen, amid criticism that various authorities failed to act to take Monis off the streets.\n&#34;The tragedy is that this has happened. I mean, this was an atrocity, it may well have been a preventable atrocity, and that\&#39;s why this swift and thorough review is so important,&#34; he said.\nMonis, who was well known to authorities but was not on any counter-terror watchlists, took 17 people hostage at a cafe in the heart of Sydney on Monday, unfurling an Islamic flag during a 16-hour siege.\nHe was killed along with two victims \x97 the cafe\&#39;s manager, 34, and a 38-year-old mother-of-three \x97 in a bloody end to the standoff.\nDetails of why police moved in when they did are sketchy but the father of a hostage who escaped said it was triggered by a group of them deciding they would &#34;not survive until the morning if they did not do something&#34;.\nBruce Herat, the lawyer father of hostage Joel Herat, 21, said Monis was awake and agitated and had begun herding the frightened hostages into separate groups.\n&#34;And at that point in time, Joel and five others came to the conclusion that they were not going to survive until the morning if they did not do something,&#34; he told Fairfax Media, adding that they decided to kick down an internal door.\n&#34;And I know that Joel made sure that Harriette (Denny) ... got behind him and he said, \&#39;You\&#39;re coming with me\&#39;, and basically made sure that all that group were ready to go when Joel and Jarrod (Hoffman) broke down the door.&#34;\nThis group were those seen fleeing seconds before heavily-armed police stormed the Lindt cafe. Police have so far not commented on the chain of events.\nAbbott has kept a high profile through the siege drama but has come under criticism from some quarters, notably about his decision to release details of a huge blow-out in the budget deficit as Australia was gripped by the unfolding Sydney events.\nInfluential broadcaster Ray Hadley, who has long backed Abbott and his conservative Liberal Party, told him during a face-to-face interview he rated his performance as &#34;D-&#34;, saying going ahead with the budget outlook was &#34;a really poor call&#34;.\nThe siege has touched a nerve among Australians, who began laying flowers at a makeshift memorial in the heart of Sydney\&#39;s financial quarter on Tuesday.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Tony Abbott\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

(AP Photo)\nRELATED\nSYDNEY: The siege at the Sydney cafe had been going on for more than five hours and 82-year-old John O\&#39;Brien had become convinced the gunman was insane and they would likely all end up dead.\nAnd so he made a decision, one he knew came with a cost: he was going to try to escape.\nO\&#39;Brien, a former professional tennis player who played at Wimbledon, looked at the gunman who was at the other end of the cafe, barricaded behind tables and chairs. The man had forced two or three young women to stand in front of him as human shields, so police snipers couldn\&#39;t take shots at him.\nO\&#39;Brien glanced up at Stefan Balafoutis, a lawyer, who was standing, as ordered, with his hands against the window. The younger man had his eyes closed.\n&#34;I said to the barrister, look, this is not going to end well, this guy will never get out of here alive, and he\&#39;s going to take everyone with him,&#34; O\&#39;Brien told Associated Press in the first detailed account from a hostage who was held inside the cafe.\nHe whispered his plan to Balafoutis. The lawyer replied: &#34;Good idea.&#34;\nO\&#39;Brien was exhausted and was wondering at times if he was in a dream. He hadn\&#39;t eaten since early in the morning, before their ordeal began, when he\&#39;d ordered a piece of raisin toast and a cappuccino.\nHe thought the coffee at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Martin Place was creamy and delicious, albeit overpriced. He liked the chocolates on display, a point of difference at the cafe. He\&#39;d visit a few times a year, often after an appointment with his eye doctor like the one he\&#39;d had that morning.\nO\&#39;Brien was eating his toast when 50-year-old Man Haron Monis strode in, wearing a bandanna with Arabic writing. He pulled out a shotgun. O\&#39;Brien looked at it, thinking it was the size of a tennis racket. He knew right away the situation was dire. The gunman grabbed Tori Johnson, the 34-year-old cafe manager, ordering him to lock the door. O\&#39;Brien said Monis was immediately aggressive and belligerent.\nThere were 17 people in the cafe that Monday who became the gunman\&#39;s hostages. Several were cafe staff in their early 20s. The customers included three lawyers and four bank workers who had popped in from nearby offices. O\&#39;Brien was the oldest while Jarrod Hoffman, a 19-year-old university student and a cafe staffer, was the youngest.\nMonis ordered the customers to stand with their hands on the cafe window and to hold up a black Shahada flag with the Islamic declaration of faith written on it. O\&#39;Brien said he stood with his hands on the window for 30 minutes, or maybe 45, it was hard to tell, before telling the gunman how old he was and saying he needed to sit down.\nIt was his first challenge to the gunman\&#39;s authority and a bit of a ruse, he said. He felt stronger than he was letting on. He\&#39;s remarkably fit for his age. He still plays competitive tennis, and is among the best in Australia in his age group. As a young man, in 1956, he made it to the fourth round of Wimbledon.\nMonis complained but relented, allowing O\&#39;Brien and a few others to sit.\nThe hours ticked by as the gunman tried to use the hostages to relay his odd demands on social media: to be delivered a flag of the Islamic State group and to speak directly to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.\nO\&#39;Brien would sometimes rest his head on the table. He thought about his wife, Maureen, whose brother had died two weeks earlier. He thought about his two daughters. And he thought about the gunman, who he became convinced was mad.\nO\&#39;Brien quietly slipped out of his seat and sat on the floor. He\&#39;d noticed that near the cafe\&#39;s front doors, there was a gap between the wall and a large advertising placard, which was perhaps 10 feet (3 meters) wide and 5 feet (1.5 meters) high. He figured the gap was less than a foot (0.3 meters) wide but knew he had to squeeze behind the sign, and reach the button controlling the doors, if his plan was to work.\nAfter several tries, he got behind the sign. Now the placard was obscuring him from the gunman. He lay down, and looked at the large green button on the wall. He wasn\&#39;t sure it would open the glass doors. If it didn\&#39;t, he figured, he would be seen by the gunman and killed.\nAlso weighing on his mind was the thought of leaving the others behind. He didn\&#39;t want to, of course, and he had no way of knowing how the gunman might react.\n&#34;I was terribly worried for them,&#34; he said.\nBut there was no turning back. He reached up and pushed the green button. A moment later, at 3:37pm, the doors opened and he was free.\nThe images of O\&#39;Brien running toward the police in his blue blazer, glancing back with Balafoutis close behind, were played around the world. The men put their hands in the air as they reached the heavily clad officers. O\&#39;Brien took a step back out into the street, gesturing back toward the cafe, before an officer pushed him behind the front line and to safety.\nOver the following hours, several more hostages escaped. The siege ended just after 2am in a barrage of gunfire when police rushed in to free the remaining captives. Two hostages, including Johnson, the cafe manager, were killed. So was the gunman.\nJohnson would be hailed a hero, after reports he brought the standoff to an end by wrestling Monis for the shotgun, saving the lives of most of his fellow hostages.\nO\&#39;Brien certainly considers Johnson a hero. He says he can\&#39;t sleep and he can\&#39;t stop thinking about Johnson and the other victim, Katrina Dawson, a 38-year-old mother of three.\n&#34;They weren\&#39;t doing anything wrong,&#34; he said.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Sydney siege,Sydney hostage,Sydney attack,John O Brien\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

The lawyer replied: &#34;Good idea.&#34;\nO\&#39;Brien was exhausted and was wondering at times if he was in a dream. He hadn\&#39;t eaten since early in the morning, before their ordeal began, when he\&#39;d ordered a piece of raisin toast and a cappuccino.\nHe thought the coffee at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Martin Place was creamy and delicious, albeit overpriced. He liked the chocolates on display, a point of difference at the cafe. He\&#39;d visit a few times a year, often after an appointment with his eye doctor like the one he\&#39;d had that morning.\nO\&#39;Brien was eating his toast when 50-year-old Man Haron Monis strode in, wearing a bandanna with Arabic writing. He pulled out a shotgun. O\&#39;Brien looked at it, thinking it was the size of a tennis racket. He knew right away the situation was dire. The gunman grabbed Tori Johnson, the 34-year-old cafe manager, ordering him to lock the door. O\&#39;Brien said Monis was immediately aggressive and belligerent.\nThere were 17 people in the cafe that Monday who became the gunman\&#39;s hostages. Several were cafe staff in their early 20s. The customers included three lawyers and four bank workers who had popped in from nearby offices. O\&#39;Brien was the oldest while Jarrod Hoffman, a 19-year-old university student and a cafe staffer, was the youngest.\nMonis ordered the customers to stand with their hands on the cafe window and to hold up a black Shahada flag with the Islamic declaration of faith written on it. O\&#39;Brien said he stood with his hands on the window for 30 minutes, or maybe 45, it was hard to tell, before telling the gunman how old he was and saying he needed to sit down.\nIt was his first challenge to the gunman\&#39;s authority and a bit of a ruse, he said. He felt stronger than he was letting on. He\&#39;s remarkably fit for his age. He still plays competitive tennis, and is among the best in Australia in his age group. As a young man, in 1956, he made it to the fourth round of Wimbledon.\nMonis complained but relented, allowing O\&#39;Brien and a few others to sit.\nThe hours ticked by as the gunman tried to use the hostages to relay his odd demands on social media: to be delivered a flag of the Islamic State group and to speak directly to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.\nO\&#39;Brien would sometimes rest his head on the table. He thought about his wife, Maureen, whose brother had died two weeks earlier. He thought about his two daughters. And he thought about the gunman, who he became convinced was mad.\nO\&#39;Brien quietly slipped out of his seat and sat on the floor. He\&#39;d noticed that near the cafe\&#39;s front doors, there was a gap between the wall and a large advertising placard, which was perhaps 10 feet (3 meters) wide and 5 feet (1.5 meters) high. He figured the gap was less than a foot (0.3 meters) wide but knew he had to squeeze behind the sign, and reach the button controlling the doors, if his plan was to work.\nAfter several tries, he got behind the sign. Now the placard was obscuring him from the gunman. He lay down, and looked at the large green button on the wall. He wasn\&#39;t sure it would open the glass doors. If it didn\&#39;t, he figured, he would be seen by the gunman and killed.\nAlso weighing on his mind was the thought of leaving the others behind. He didn\&#39;t want to, of course, and he had no way of knowing how the gunman might react.\n&#34;I was terribly worried for them,&#34; he said.\nBut there was no turning back. He reached up and pushed the green button. A moment later, at 3:37pm, the doors opened and he was free.\nThe images of O\&#39;Brien running toward the police in his blue blazer, glancing back with Balafoutis close behind, were played around the world. The men put their hands in the air as they reached the heavily clad officers. O\&#39;Brien took a step back out into the street, gesturing back toward the cafe, before an officer pushed him behind the front line and to safety.\nOver the following hours, several more hostages escaped. The siege ended just after 2am in a barrage of gunfire when police rushed in to free the remaining captives. Two hostages, including Johnson, the cafe manager, were killed. So was the gunman.\nJohnson would be hailed a hero, after reports he brought the standoff to an end by wrestling Monis for the shotgun, saving the lives of most of his fellow hostages.\nO\&#39;Brien certainly considers Johnson a hero. He says he can\&#39;t sleep and he can\&#39;t stop thinking about Johnson and the other victim, Katrina Dawson, a 38-year-old mother of three.\n&#34;They weren\&#39;t doing anything wrong,&#34; he said.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Sydney siege,Sydney hostage,Sydney attack,John O Brien\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

This is particularly true in Moscow, where people have become accustomed to imported goods and foreign travel, now once again off-limits for many because of the fall of the ruble and Western sanctions over Ukraine.\nThe poll was conducted between November 22 and December 7, when the ruble was steadily declining. But this week\&#39;s catastrophic collapse is likely to have a much greater effect on consumer prices and the standard of living.\nFor Putin, the question is whether he will be able to convince Russians to tighten their belts, and not just for a few months but possibly for years to come.\n&#34;The Russian people have a sense that they are under sanctions, they are a fortress under siege,&#34; said Maria Lipman, an independent analyst. &#34;This kind of mentality is disseminated consistently and steadily by Russian television: Who else is there to rely on except Putin? Putin is seen as the savior of the nation, and I think he sees himself in this fashion.&#34;\nPutin will address his countrymen\&#39;s concerns over the course of three or four hours at Thursday\&#39;s news conference. He seems all but certain to send the message that he is in charge and all is fine.\nAn advertisement for the news conference running on state television shows Putin surrounded by Sochi Olympic athletes, petting a baby tiger and greeting cosmonauts. &#34;We are absolutely capable of doing everything ourselves,&#34; he promises the audience.\nHow Russians view Putin is associated with how they get their news, the poll showed. Those who identified state television as their main source of news are more likely to approve of Putin (84 percent) than those who have other sources (73 percent), while those who tune into the news often also have a more favorable opinion of him.\nAfter becoming president in 2000, Putin benefited from high prices for oil, the mainstay of Russia\&#39;s economy. In the past decade, Russians saw their living standards rise faster than at any other point in modern history, transforming many average citizens into car owners and globe-trotters for the first time ever.\nThe suppression of opposition politicians and independent media, widely criticized by outside observers, was tacitly accepted by many as a compromise worth making for economic stability after the roller coaster years of the 1990s.\n&#34;I very much support Putin - who else is there to support?&#34; said Valentina Roshupkina, a 79-year-old resident of Gryaz, a town several hours\&#39; drive south of Moscow. &#34;The country is moving in the right direction, I believe, because he lifted up the army, he made the government stronger. People started to be a little bit afraid of us.&#34;\nPoll respondents were asked whether they would be willing to speak with an AP reporter, and Roshupkina was among the many who agreed.\nWith the Russian economy buffeted by Western sanctions and the fall in oil prices, Putin has relied even more on his image as a tough leader capable of standing up to the West. He appears to be betting that this will help him weather the economic storm.\nSo far he\&#39;s been right: The presidency and the military are the country\&#39;s most trusted institutions, according to the poll, with three out of four Russians saying they trust the presidency and two out of three expressing faith in the military.\n&#34;We\&#39;ve revived the army and that\&#39;s very important,&#34; said Ivan Savenko, a 50-year-old driver in the southern city of Stavropol who also took part in the poll. &#34;For us, the most important thing is the army and then everything else. It\&#39;s important for us that our country is a power. If we are not a power, we do not exist.&#34;\nOf those surveyed, 81 percent said they strongly or somewhat approve of the way Putin is handling his job, a dramatic increase of more than 20 percentage points from an AP-GfK poll conducted in 2012.\nWhile Russia has become more authoritarian under Putin, the support for him appears genuine. The significant fluctuation in Putin\&#39;s ratings in recent years also indicates that Russians feel able to respond freely in anonymous surveys about their views on the president. The 81 percent approval rating is only slightly higher statistically than the 74 percent measured during the same time period by the Levada Center, Russia\&#39;s most respected independent pollster.\nMany analysts question, however, whether the high ratings have any significance, given the Kremlin\&#39;s control over information.\n&#34;There is a total, effective, monopolistic propaganda campaign, and if there is an information monopoly, how can you talk about ratings?&#34; said Georgy Satarov, a former Kremlin adviser who heads a research institute that studies corruption.\n&#34;The thing you have to pay attention to is not the fact that 80 percent support him, but that despite that information monopoly 15 percent don\&#39;t support him,&#34; he said.\nSupport for Putin soared after he moved to seize the Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March.\n&#34;A source of pride for the overwhelming majority of Russians is the victory of World War II, but that was already 70 years ago,&#34; Lipman said. &#34;(In Crimea) Putin gave the sense that we are victorious and triumphant and resurgent today.&#34;\nThe Russia-backed separatists who took up arms against government troops in eastern Ukraine also have been portrayed as heroes on state television. Of the Russians polled, 69 percent said that many or some parts of Ukraine rightfully belong to Russia.\nBut some, like 37-year-old librarian Yelena Shevilyova, said that although she approves of Putin, she believes Russia\&#39;s involvement in Ukraine may have come at too high a cost.\n&#34;I think we lost a lot in our lives because of this,&#34; said Shevilyova, another poll participant, referring to Crimea.\n&#34;I think that it is right to bring all of these (Russian-speaking regions) back, but we need everything to be good here too. ... You can\&#39;t have everything at once,&#34; she said, speaking from the far northern region of Perm.\nGrowing worries about a worsening economy and the impact of sanctions are more keenly felt in major cities. In Moscow, more than 6 in 10 said they had been negatively affected by the sanctions and most said their family\&#39;s finances were worse than three years ago. Less than half felt that way elsewhere.\n&#34;I am afraid that Russia isn\&#39;t going anywhere,&#34; said Dmitry Uryupin, 48, a sound director in a small production firm in Moscow who was among those surveyed. &#34;It\&#39;s unlikely that wages will be raised. In fact, it\&#39;s quite likely the opposite will happen, unemployment will rise and it will all affect the most economically insecure people as well as us, the creative class.&#34;\nAfter Putin was inaugurated for a third term in 2012 after a wave of protests in Moscow driven by the creative class, he clamped down even harder on the opposition and focused on his core electorate: people in the provinces and those more dependent on the state for their income.\nThe disgruntled in Moscow have proved easy to discredit in the eyes of what is known as the Putin majority: &#34;Look at these poor Muscovites. ... Oh my God, they complain because they cannot go to Italy on vacation and they can no longer afford to buy Parmesan cheese!&#34; Lipman said.\nWhether discontent not just with the economy but with Putin\&#39;s leadership will grow, Lipman said, depends on &#34;how badly this will hurt, and for how long.&#34;\nThe AP-NORC Center poll of Russia was conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago with fieldwork for the in-person survey by GfK Russia from November 22-December 7. It is based on 2,008 in person interviews with a nationally representative random sample of Russians age 18 and older.\nFunding for the survey came from NORC at the University of Chicago.\nResults for all adults have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=World War II,University of Chicago,Ukraine,Moscow,economy\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\x92s mobile apps.

(Reuters photo)\nPage 1  of 4\nHAVANA: Cubans cheered the surprise announcement that their country will restore relations with the United States, hopeful they\&#39;ll soon see expanded trade and new economic vibrancy even though the 53-year-old economic embargo remains in place for the time being.\n&#34;This opens a better future for us,&#34; said Milagros Diaz, 34. &#34;We have really needed something like this because the situation has been bad and the people very discouraged.&#34;\nBells tolled in celebration and teachers halted lessons midday as  President Raul Castro told his country on Wednesday that Cuba would renew relations with Washington after more than a half-century of hostility.\nWearing his military uniform with its five-star insignia, the 83-year-old leader said the two countries would work to resolve their differences &#34;without renouncing a single one of our principles.&#34;\nHavana residents gathered around television sets in homes, schools and businesses to hear the historic national broadcast, which coincided with a statement by US President Barack Obama in Washington. Uniformed schoolchildren burst into applause at the news.\nAt the University of San Geronimo in the capital\&#39;s historic center, the announcement drew ringing from the bell tower. Throughout the capital, there was a sense of euphoria as word spread.\n&#34;For the Cuban people, I think this is like a shot of oxygen, a wish-come-true, because with this, we have overcome our differences,&#34; said Carlos Gonzalez, a 32-year-old IT specialist. &#34;It is an advance that will open the road to a better future for the two countries.&#34;\nFidel and  Raul Castro led the 1959 rebellion that toppled the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. The US initially recognized the new government but broke relations in 1961 after Cuba veered sharply to the left and nationalized US-owned businesses.\nAs Cuba turned toward the Soviet Union, the US imposed a trade embargo in 1962. Particularly since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Cubans have confronted severe shortages of oil, food and consumer goods, forcing them to ration everything from beans to powdered milk.\nThe Cuban government blames most of its economic travails on the embargo, while Washington has traditionally blamed Cuba\&#39;s Communist economic policies.\nIn his address, Castro called on Washington to end its trade embargo which, he said, &#34;has caused enormous human and economic damage.&#34;\nRamon Roman, 62, said he hoped to see Cuba welcome more tourists. &#34;It would be a tremendous economic injection, both in terms of money and in new energy and would be a boost for average people who need it,&#34; he said.\nVictoria Serrano, a lab worker, said she hoped to see an influx of new goods because life in Cuba has been &#34;really very difficult.&#34;\n&#34;In particular,&#34; she said, &#34;I hope we\&#39;ll see an improvement in food _ that there is trade in this with the United States, which is so close. Right now, even an onion has become a luxury.&#34;\nAround the cathedral in Old Havana, people gathered in doorways and on sidewalks, gesturing excitedly as they discussed the news.\nGuillermo Delgado, a 72-year-old retiree, welcomed the announcement as &#34;a victory for Cuba because it was achieved without conceding basic principles.&#34;\nYoani Sanchez, a renowned Cuban blogger critical of the government, noted the development came with a price. Castro, she said, could now claim a triumph and that he had made a &#34;bargaining chip&#34; of Alan Gross, the US aid worker who was released from prison Wednesday while the US freed three Cubans held as spies.\n&#34;In this way, the Castro regime has managed to get its way,&#34; she wrote in a blog post. &#34;It has managed to exchange a peaceful man, embarked on the humanitarian adventure of providing Internet connectivity to a group of Cubans, for intelligence agents that caused significant damage and sorrow with their actions.&#34;\nSome dissidents expressed their displeasure at not being consulted by the US government about the historic move.\nDissident Guillermo Farinas considered the move a &#34;betrayal&#34; by Obama who, he said, had promised that they would be consulted. Another activist, Antonio Rodiles, said the measure &#34;sends a bad message.&#34;\nOthers, meanwhile, were cautious, saying they\&#39;ll wait and see what it all means.\n&#34;It\&#39;s not enough since it doesn\&#39;t lift the blockade,&#34; said Pedro Duran, 28. &#34;We\&#39;ll see if it\&#39;s true, if it\&#39;s not like everything here: one step forward and three steps back.

(Reuters photo)\nPage 1  of 4\nNEW YORK: Under the threat of terrorist attacks from hackers and with the nation&#39;s largest multiplex chains pulling the film from their screens,  Sony Pictures Entertainment took the unprecedented step of canceling the Dec. 25 release of the  Seth Rogen comedy &#39;&#39;The Interview.&#39;&#39;\nThe cancellation announced Wednesday was a startling blow to the Hollywood studio that has been shaken by hacker leaks and intimidations over the last several weeks by an anonymous group calling itself  Guardians of Peace.\nA U.S. official said Wednesday that federal investigators have now connected the Sony hacking to North Korea and are expected to make an announcement in the near future. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to openly discuss an ongoing criminal case.\nSony said it was cancelling ``The Interview&#39;&#39; release ``in light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film.&#39;&#39; The studio said it respected and shared in the exhibitors&#39; concerns.\n``We are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie, and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public,&#39;&#39; read the statement. ``We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.&#39;&#39;\nSeemingly putting to rest any hope of a delayed theatrical release or a video-on-demand release Sony Pictures spokesperson Jean Guerin later added: ``Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film.&#39;&#39;\nEarlier Wednesday, Regal Cinemas, AMC Entertainment and Cinemark Theatres _ the three top theater chains in North America _ announced that they were postponing any showings of ``The Interview.&#39;&#39; The comedy, about a TV host (James Franco) and producer (Rogen) tasked by the CIA to assassinate North Korea leader Kim Jung-un (played by Randall Park), has inflamed North Korea for parodying its leader.\nRegal said in a statement that it was delaying ``The Interview&#39;&#39; ``due to wavering support of the film ... by Sony Pictures, as well as the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats.&#39;&#39; AMC noted ``the overall confusion and uncertainty&#39;&#39; surrounding the film.\nSony had offered theaters the option of bowing out, and when so many of them did (other chains to drop it included ArcLight Cinemas, Cineplex Entertainment and Carmike Cinemas), Sony was left with little choice.\nOn Tuesday, the hacking group threatened violence at ``the very times and places&#39;&#39; showing ``The Interview.&#39;&#39; The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday there was ``no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters,&#39;&#39; but noted it was still analyzing messages from the group. The warning did prompt law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles to address measures to ramp up security.\nPresident Barack Obama commented the hacking Wednesday in an interview with ABC News.\n``The cyberattack is very serious,&#39;&#39; said Obama. ``We&#39;re investigating and we&#39;re taking it seriously. We&#39;ll be vigilant. If we see something that we think is serious and credible then we&#39;ll alert the public. But for now, my recommendation would be that people go to the movies.&#39;&#39;\nWith a modest budget of about $40 million, ``The Interview&#39;&#39; was predicted to earn around $30 million in its opening weekend before Tuesday&#39;s threats. Sony also stands to lose tens of millions in marketing costs already incurred.\n``This attack went to the heart and core of Sony&#39;s business _ and succeeded,&#39;&#39; said Avivah Litan, a cybersecurity analyst at research firm Gartner. ``We haven&#39;t seen any attack like this in the annals of U.S. breach history.&#39;&#39;\nSony was also under pressure from other studios. Christmas is one of the most important box-office weekends of the year, and the threats could have scared moviegoers away. Releases include Universal&#39;s ``Unbroken,&#39;&#39; Paramount&#39;s ``The Gambler,&#39;&#39; and Disney&#39;s ``Into the Woods.&#39;&#39; Sony&#39;s musical ``Annie,&#39;&#39; also expected to be a big earner, debuts Friday.\nDoug Stone, president of film industry newsletter Box Office Analyst, had predicted that ``The Interview&#39;&#39; could have made $75 to $100 million. With Sony taking about 55 percent of domestic revenues, that could mean a $41 to $55 million revenue loss, according to Stone.\nSony&#39;s announcement was met with widespread distress across Hollywood and by others watching the unfolding attack on Sony. A former senior national security official in the George W. Bush administration said the company made the wrong decision.\n``When you are confronted with a bully the idea is not to cave but to punch him in the nose,&#39;&#39; Fran Townsend, Bush&#39;s homeland security adviser, said Wednesday during a previously scheduled appearance in Washington. ``This is a horrible, I think, horrible precedent.&#39;&#39;\n&#34;, u&#39;The Times of India\nYou are here: Home \xa0\u0165\xa0 World \xa0\u0165\xa0Middle East\nRELATED ARTICLES\nMass grave of 230 killed by jihadists found in Syria: monitor\nThe author has posted comments on this article\nAFP | Dec 18, 2014, 04.15AM IST\nRebel fighters walk around al-Hamidiyeh base, one of two military posts they took control of from forces loyal to Syria\&#39;s President Bashar al-Assad in the northwestern province of Idlib December 15, 2014.

Another reporter was housed in a dormitory where 12 workers shared a cramped room.\nApple says the dormitory overcrowding has now been resolved and that it requires suppliers to retroactively pay workers if it finds they haven\&#39;t been paid for work meetings.\nPegatron said it was carefully investigating Panorama\&#39;s claims and would take all necessary action if any deficiencies were found at their facilities.\n&#34;Worker safety and well-being are our top priorities. We set very high standards, conduct rigorous training for managers and workers, and have external auditors regularly visiting our facilities to find areas for improvement,&#34; a statement said.\nDangerous conditions\nPanorama also travelled further down Apple\&#39;s supply chain to the Indonesian island of Bangka.\nApple says it is dedicated to the ethical sourcing of minerals, but the programme found evidence that tin from illegal mines could be entering its supply chain.\nIt found children digging tin ore out by hand in extremely dangerous conditions - miners can be buried alive when the walls of sand or mud collapse.\nRainto, 12, said he was worried about landslides\nTwelve-year-old Rianto was working with his dad at the bottom of a 70-foot cliff of sand. He said: &#34;I worry about landslides. The earth slipping from up there to the bottom. It could happen.&#34;\nPanorama tracked down a gang who collect tin from the area where Rianto was working. One of them said they sold tin to a smelter on Apple\&#39;s list of suppliers.\nJohan Murod, who runs one of the smelters on Apple\&#39;s list, said 70% of the tin that is exported comes from the small-scale mines.\n&#34;At the smelter there\&#39;s everything from both large and small scale mines. It\&#39;s all mixed.  There\&#39;s no way to know what is legal and what is illegal.&#34;\nApple says it is a complex situation on Bangka with tens of thousands of miners selling tin through many middle men.\n&#34;The simplest course of action would be for Apple to unilaterally refuse any tin from Indonesian mines. That would be easy for us to do and would certainly shield us from criticism.\n&#34;But that would also be the lazy and cowardly path, since it would do nothing to improve the situation. We have chosen to stay engaged and attempt to drive changes on the ground.&#34;\nWatch Panorama: Apple\&#39;s Broken Promises on BBC One on 18 December at 21:00 GMT or watch later on BBC iPlayer.\nMore on This Story\n\xa0\n06:48: Gas prices BBC Radio 4\nProfessor Green says energy suppliers have an eye on politics at the moment.

Mojang has produced a short browser-based game called Info Quest II to explain what it might be like.\nIn a blogpost, Mojang said the game would be developed with the help of the Minecraft community.\nIt sought to reassure players that Story Mode would not be like the violent and bloody games Telltale has produced before now. Recent Telltale games include The Wolf Among Us, Tales from the Borderlands and titles based on Game of Thrones and zombie thriller The Walking Dead.\n&#34;Telltale\&#39;s game will feel similar in tone to Minecraft itself,&#34; said Mojang, &#34;though it\&#39;s a totally original take inspired by our game.&#34;\nThe news about Story Mode comes soon after Mojang released a finished version of its Scrolls card-based magic battling game.\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Net overseers hit by phishing attack\nBy spoofing emails attackers tricked Icann staff into handing over login names and passwords\nHackers have managed to penetrate the network used by the organisation that oversees the net.\nIcann, which administers the net\&#39;s addressing system, said spoofed emails were used to reach an internal network.\nThe attackers used this access to steal lists of contact and login information for people who control some of the net\&#39;s most popular domains.\nIcann said it had notified people that their data may have gone astray and asked them to change their passwords.\nIcann, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, was set up to oversee the underlying addressing system that keeps the net running and ensures data gets where it is supposed to go.\nIn a blogpost , Icann said some of its staff were tricked into opening booby-trapped email messages sent by attackers that were crafted to look like they came from other employees.\nThe attack took place in late November and Icann realised it had been attacked about a week later.\nThe booby-trapped emails helped the attackers capture login name and password details for Icann\&#39;s internal network that attackers then used to snoop around the organisation\&#39;s systems.\nAn investigation by Icann revealed that the attackers got at a system called the Centralised Zone Data System (CZDS) that lists who looks after what is known as generic top-level domains. This includes the widely used .com, .info, .net and .org domains as well as a host of other more recently established domains.\nIcann said it was not possible to alter any details of who administers these domains from its CZDS system.\nPasswords were stored in a hard to crack format, said Icann, and added it had deactivated passwords so those with legitimate access to CZDS would have to generate a new one.\n&#34;Based on our investigation to date, we are not aware of any other systems that have been compromised,&#34; it said, adding that it had now put in place more stringent security systems to prevent another breach.\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;\&#39;Angry\&#39; Snapchat embroiled in Sony Pictures hack\nBy Dave Lee Technology reporter, BBC News\nSnapchat boss Evan Spiegel said keeping company secrets was &#34;painful&#34;\nA guide to the Sony Pictures hack\nSnapchat founder Evan Spiegel has said he is &#34;devastated&#34; and &#34;angry&#34; that plans for his messaging app were leaked as part of the Sony Pictures hack.\nDetails of future ideas and strategy were outlined by Mr Spiegel in emails to Michael Lynton, a Sony executive who sits on Snapchat\&#39;s board.\nAlso included were details, including financial data, on previously unpublicised acquisitions.\n&#34;I felt like I was going to cry all morning,&#34; Mr Spiegel said in a memo.\n&#34;I went on a walk and thought through a couple things.&#34;\n\&#39;Huge hug\&#39;\nMr Spiegel later shared on Twitter the emotional note he sent to Snapchat\&#39;s employees, entitled Keeping Secrets.\n&#34;I\&#39;ve been feeling a lot of things since our business plans were made public last night,&#34; he wrote.\n&#34;Definitely angry.

Google&#39;s Chrome browser, first released in 2008, is the most popular with a 50% share and about 20% of people use Firefox.\nThe browser ballot was only seen in Europe on new PCs running Windows XP, Vista and 7 and on machines where a fresh copy of those versions of Windows was installed.\nThe European Commission said offering people a choice of browser had proved successful and that in its first eight months 84 million browsers were downloaded via the choice screen.\nMicrosoft was threatened with heavy fines if it did not properly implement and maintain the ballot. It was hit with a 561m euro (\u0141441m) fine in March 2013 because it failed to include the ballot screen on Windows 7  Service Pack 1 for 14 months.\nThe browser choice system was agreed on 16 December, 2009 and was first seen on copies of Windows in March 2010.\nNews about the ending of the ballot emerged from a service update Microsoft posted to its support site .

Earlier this week one dollar was worth 79 roubles though the currency has recovered since and now $1 buys about 61 roubles.\nValve\&#39;s move is the first time that region locks have been imposed on games available via the hugely popular Steam service.

smartphone, the Blackberry Classic.\nThe device has a full &#34;Qwerty&#34; keyboard, resembling the design which made Blackberry a market leader before it was overtaken by competitors.\nAnalysts said the firm was going &#34;back to its roots&#34; in order to appeal to business customers.\nBut some warned that while this tactic would help retain business, it might not attract new users.\n&#34;This is more about avoiding more people leaving than necessarily winning many over,&#34; said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst for Kantar Worldpanel.\n&#34;I have a hard time thinking that people who grew up on touch[screens] will see this as an exciting \&#39;retro\&#39; trend and embrace it.&#34;\nChallenging year\nThe Classic has an eight-megapixel camera on its reverse and, as well as the physical keyboard, the device can be controlled via its 3.5-inch touchscreen.\nBlackberry has had a challenging year, albeit one showing at least some positive signs for the company formerly known as Research in Motion.\nNews in March of annual losses of $5.9bn (\u01413.5bn) highlighted the company\&#39;s slip from being a major smartphone player.\nHowever, after significant cost-cutting, and with higher profit margins, the company was able to overcome a drop in revenues to post a profit of $23m (\u014114m) for the three months to the end of March 2014.\nMore recently, the company impressed technology enthusiasts with the Blackberry Passport, a distinctive smartphone which, like the Classic, made use of a physical keyboard.\nThe Blackberry Passport\&#39;s distinctive design proved popular\n&#34;Knowing your strengths and recognising your weaknesses could be Blackberry\&#39;s way back from the brink,&#34; said Rob Kerr, mobiles expert at Uswitch.com.\n&#34;Like its Passport phone, the mobile maker has gone back to its roots with the Classic - furnishing it with the physical keyboard that so many appreciate in the touchscreen era.\n&#34;Keyboard phones were always its strong point and this true return to form hails back to Blackberry\&#39;s glory days.\n&#34;Although this handset is unlikely to capture the once strong youth market, businesses might once again come back to the fold.&#34;\nBlackberry\&#39;s executive chairman, John Chen, said the Classic was built after gathering feedback from &#34;dedicated&#34;

system.\nMany sites have adopted the secure version of the basic web protocol to help safeguard data.\nThe proposal was made by the Google developers working on the search firm\&#39;s Chrome browser.\nSecurity experts broadly welcomed the proposal but said it could cause confusion initially.\nScrambled data\nThe proposal to mark HTTP connections as non-secure was made in a message posted to the Chrome development website by Google engineers working on the firm\&#39;s browser.\nIf implemented, the developers wrote, the change would mean that a warning would pop-up when people visited a site that used only HTTP to notify them that such a connection &#34;provides no data security&#34;.\nIt will be a good thing for the whole web in the long run\x94\nEnd Quote Paul Mutton Netcraft\nThe team said it was odd that browsers currently did nothing to warn people when their data was unprotected.\n&#34;The only situation in which web browsers are guaranteed not to warn users is precisely when there is no chance of security,&#34; they wrote.\nHTTPS uses well-established cryptographic systems to scramble data as it travels from a user\&#39;s computer to a website and back again.\nThe team said warnings were needed because it was known that cyber thieves and government agencies were abusing insecure connections to steal data or spy on people.\nRik Ferguson, a senior analyst at security firm Trend Micro, said warning people when they were using an insecure connection was &#34;a good idea&#34;.\n&#34;People seem to make the assumption that communications such as HTTP and email are private to a degree when exactly the opposite is the case,&#34; he said.\nWebsite operators might need help adopting the HTTPS system, say experts\nLetting people know when their connection to a website is insecure could drive sites to adopt more secure protocols, he said.\nCurrently only about 33% of websites use HTTPS, according to statistics gathered by the Trustworthy Internet Movement which monitors the way sites use more secure browsing technologies.\n\&#39;Headache\&#39;\nPaul Mutton, a security analyst at web monitoring firm Netcraft, also welcomed the proposal, saying it was &#34;bizarre&#34; that an unencrypted HTTP connection gave rise to no warnings at all.\n&#34;In the short term, the biggest headache is likely to be faced by website operators who will feel forced to migrate unencrypted HTTP websites to encrypted HTTPS,&#34; he said. Many may resent the cost in time and money required to adopt the technology, he said, even though projects exist to make it easier and free for website administrators to use HTTPS.\n&#34;It will seem like a lot of hassle in the short term, but it will be a good thing for the whole web in the long run,&#34; he said.\nThe Google proposal was also floated on discussion boards for other browsers and received guarded support from the Mozilla team behind the Firefox browser and those involved with Opera.\nMany large websites and services, including Twitter, Yahoo, Facebook and GMail, already use HTTPS by default. In addition, since September Google has prioritised HTTPS sites in its search rankings.\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Jeans made that will prevent \&#39;digital pickpocketing\&#39;\nThe jeans have pockets that block RFID signals\nThe rise of the Swedish cyborgs\nA pair of jeans containing material that blocks wireless signals is being developed in conjunction with anti-virus firm Norton.\nThe trousers are intended to stop thieves hacking into radio frequency identification (RFID) tagged passports or contactless payment cards.\nAccording to security experts this type of theft is a growing problem.\nThe jeans are designed by online clothing company Betabrand and use a silver-based material to block signals.\nThey are due to go on sale in February.\nSecurity software maker Norton teamed up with San Francisco-based Betabrand in October to make the jeans and a blazer. The jeans will retail at $151 (\u014196) and the blazer at $198.\nThe majority of credit and debit cards are fitted with Near Field Communication chips, a type of RFID tech\nDigital forensic firm Disklabs has used similar technology to make a wallet, which, like the Betabrand jeans, blocks RFID signals.\n&#34;There is technology readily available for anyone to snatch other people\&#39;s credit and debit card data within seconds,&#34; said Disklabs boss Simon Steggles.\n&#34;These apps simply copy the card with all the information on it.&#34;\nHis firm also designs &#34;faraday&#34; bags which block mobile signals. Such bags are often used by police now to store mobile phones taken from suspects.\nLast month the BBC reported that several police forces around the country had admitted that some mobile phones confiscated from suspects had been remotely wiped because they had not been stored in a secure way.\nWearable hacks\nDisklab\&#39;s RFID-blocking wallet will go on sale in the new year\nEthical hacker Ken Munro is also acutely aware of the problem of RFID hacking. His firm, Pen Test Partners, has developed him a proof-of-concept RFID-blocking suit.\nMade of cloth woven with metal fibres, the suit was not cheap to make but is washable.\n&#34;If we are not explicitly blocking these signals there are a lot of things that can go wrong, from stealing contactless payment card details to more life-threatening issues,&#34; he told the BBC.\nHe thinks the RFID jeans may not be a sufficient defence against hackers.\n&#34;The pockets are shielded but nothing else.

And, in the end, Lord Sugar only selected two finalists.\nAmong those leaving the show was bookmakers\&#39; favourite Roisin Hogan.\nThe 32-year-old chartered accountant from Ireland had impressed by inventing a successful, geography-based board game and convincing leading supermarkets to buy 25,500 tea-infused cheesecakes.\nBut her business plan - a low carbohydrate ready meal - failed to impress Lord Sugar and his advisers.\nRoisin Hogan had kept a level head throughout the process, but fell at the final hurdle\nHogan said she did not regret giving up her job to take part in the TV show.\n&#34;I\&#39;ve taken Lord Sugar\&#39;s advice on board, and his advisers\&#39; advice on board and I\&#39;ve scaled back my ambition somewhat,&#34; she said.\n&#34;I\&#39;ve partnered with a industry expert and we are going to bring the product to market hopefully in early 2015.&#34;\nFumbled pitch\nSolomon Akhtar was also dismissed from the boardroom, having submitted a flimsy business proposal that amounted to just eight pages - with pictures.\n&#34;I think I was too ambitious for Lord Sugar and too outgoing,&#34; said the 22-year-old, after being fired.\n&#34;He\&#39;s not a fun person. He\&#39;s very boring, he wears a suit, he\&#39;s very money-orientated. He just doesn\&#39;t get life.\n&#34;I think that\&#39;s probably why I got shouted out of the room because I actually have a personality and I\&#39;m not boring.&#34;\nPub quiz company director Daniel Lassman also left the competition, after suffering a series of blunders and awkward moments.\nDuring the 10-week interview process, he drafted a set of baffling, misogynistic questions for a board game called The Relationship Guru and sabotaged the sale of a high-tech sweater by telling potential buyers: &#34;You wouldn\&#39;t go in a public place with it.&#34;\nBianca Miller and Mark Wright survived the semi-final\nAfter getting the chop, he suggested he would be interested in taking part in other reality series.\n&#34;If it just so happens that a particular show puts up a lot of money for me to go on, we\&#39;ll cross that bridge when I come to it.&#34;\nBut he added: &#34;It\&#39;s not something you go on to a show like this for. I think it\&#39;s highly documented that I turned down an offer from Towie [The Only Way Is Essex] when I was younger. If I\&#39;d wanted to go down that route, I could have.&#34;\nThe two remaining contestants are Bianca Miller, whose business proposal for Lord Sugar is a hosiery company for women with different skin tones.\nSales manager Mark Wright, whose plan is to launch a digital marketing company, is also in the running, having excelled at selling tasks during the TV show.\nIn one week, he sold seven hot tubs to a single customer - but he also fumbled a crucial sales pitch in the quarter-finals.\nThe pair are fighting for the chance to win a \u0141250,000 investment.\nThe winner will be decided in the final episode on Sunday 21 December.\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Rouble turmoil leads to Apple halting online sales in Russia\nRouble in free-fall despite rate rise\nTechnology giant Apple says it cannot sell products online in Russia because the rouble\&#39;s value is too volatile for it to set prices.\nThe company stopped sales of its iPhones, iPads and other products in the country after a day in which the currency went into free-fall.\nThe rouble has lost more than 20% this week, despite a dramatic decision to raise interest rates from 10.5% to 17%.\nLast Updated at 19 Dec 2014, 06:50 *Chart shows local time\n$1 buys\n+\n+0.00\nIts all time low, set on Wednesday, saw one dollar buying as many as 79 roubles.\nApple last month increased its prices in Russia by 20% after the weakening rouble left products in the country cheaper than in the rest of Europe.\nRussia\&#39;s central bank said on Wednesday it had spent almost $2bn intervening in the currency market on Monday.\nIt has spent around $80bn trying to prop up its rouble this year, but despite that, the currency has lost more than half its value against the dollar since January, with cheaper oil and Western sanctions over its stance over Ukraine the chief factors.\nBoth of these have weakened the Russian economy.\nRussia\&#39;s central bank has pledged fresh further measures to try to stabilise its currency, with First Deputy Governor Sergei Shvetsov describing the situation as &#34;critical&#34;.\nJohn Simpson asks if the currency crisis will affect Putin\&#39;s popularity\nThe rouble\&#39;s slide this week was prompted by fears that the US was considering a fresh set of sanctions against the country for its support for separatists in Ukraine.\nMore on This Story\n\xa0\n06:48: Gas prices BBC Radio 4\nProfessor Green says energy suppliers have an eye on politics at the moment.

The Mystery of the Sony Pictures Hack\nBy Jane Wakefield Technology reporter\nSony Pictures computer system hacked\nIt has become the whodunnit that is gripping Hollywood without a penny being spent on production.\nNow The Mystery of the Sony Pictures Hack - which already had all the ingredients for a major Hollywood film - has taken a new twist as the movie at the heart of the row is pulled.\nThat raises a whole host of questions but the key one - who was behind the attack - remains unanswered.\nTo help get to the bottom of the mystery, the BBC turned detective and considered the evidence.\nWhat we know so far:\nWhat isn\&#39;t in doubt, despite Sony\&#39;s desire to write a script where it wakes up and it was all a bad dream, is that the film giant\&#39;s internal computer system was hacked in November.\nThe group responsible called itself The Guardians of Peace and warned that if its demands were not met, secret data would be &#34;shown to the world&#34;. Crucially though it did not outline its demands.\nA number of as-yet unreleased films popped up on online download sites. The Interview, a comedy featuring a plot to assassinate North Korea\&#39;s leader Kim Jong-un, was not among those released.\nThe hackers also released the salary and social security numbers of thousands of Sony employees - including celebrities.\nFollowing threats of 9/11 style incidents at any cinema that screened the film from the group behind the hack, Sony announced that it was cancelling the release of the movie altogether.\nWho are the prime suspects?\nA nation state, most likely North Korea\nSupporters of North Korean regime, based in China\nHackers with a money-making motive\nHackers or a lone individual with another motive, such as revenge\nThe case for North Korea:\nThe leadership made no secret of its anger at the imminent release of The Interview\nThe case for North Korea being behind the attack seems, at least on the face of it, to be a compelling one.\nIt has a motive and a history of hacking.\nIts leadership certainly did not disguise its anger about the forthcoming Sony film The Interview.\nIn fact, it described the film as &#34;an act of terrorism&#34;.\nAnd rather like a robbery being pinned on a local criminal who has a history of similar offences, North Korea has form.\nMany are pointing the finger of suspicion firmly towards the crime Unit 121 of North Korea\&#39;s General Bureau of Reconnaissance, described by some commentators as the country\&#39;s most elite hacking unit.\nAnd shortly after news that the film was pulled, the New York Times ran an article quoting an unnamed government source as saying it believed that attack to be state-sponsored with the North Korean government involved.\nThe case against:\nWho else might be to blame?\nIt might not be the most compelling evidence but it is worth noting that  North Korea denied that it was behind the attack, saying instead that it was the work of someone sympathetic to its cause. It hardly ever bothers to deny such claims.\nNorth Korea is not averse to a bit of hacking but many say that the history of this particular crime does not fit with its modus operandus.\nIts usual target is South Korea where attacks such as one launched in March 2013 have taken down internal networks.\nBlogger Marc Rogers drills down into the details of this particular hack.\nHe concludes that the fact that the code was written on a PC with Korean locale and language actually makes it less likely North Korea is the source.\nHe points out that they do not speak traditional Korean in North Korea, they speak their own dialect and traditional Korean is forbidden.\n&#34;Let\&#39;s not forget also that it is trivial to change the language/locale of a computer before compiling code on it,&#34; he writes.\nHe also points out that the the hackers are very net and social-media savvy. &#34;That and the sophistication of the operation, do not match with the profile of the DPRK (Democratic People\&#39;s Republic of Korea).&#34;\nBut perhaps his most compelling piece of evidence is the fact that the attackers only latched onto The Interview connection after the media suggested that North Korea might be linked to the attack.\nSo if not North Korea then who?\nWho else would have a motive for the attack?\nIn his blog, Mr Rogers writes &#34;I would find the presence of Chinese far more plausible&#34; and others also think that Chinese hackers, possibly recruited by North Korea, are a far more likely source of the malware.\nOther think it may be hackers out to make some money.\nWhen the hack was first reported there was little to suggest a monetary motive but actually the hackers emailed five top Sony Pictures executives on November 21, days before they began leaking the files, and demanded money.\nSean Sullivan, a senior researcher at security company F-Secure, believes extortion could be the motive behind the hack.\n&#34;That is a lot more credible than a nation state,&#34; he told the BBC.\nFor him, the real test will  be what the hackers do next.\nIf the pulling of The Interview was their primary motive, things should quieten down but if there are more data dumps, then he thinks everyone should pretty much dismiss North Korea as the source.\n&#34;I would even bet they dump The Interview on to a torrent site unless Sony puts some money in a brown paper bag,&#34; he said.\nLike Mr Rogers, he does not rule out the involvement of Chinese hackers.\n&#34;It is far more likely that North Korea would have recruited Chinese hackers who both wanted to make some money and cause Sony pain,&#34; he said.\nIf the sorry tale were to be turned into a Hollywood movie and, given the times we live in, it almost certainly will - although probably not made by Sony - a better plotline might be anonymous hackers intent on revenge.\nTo understand how this might be a possibility requires a bit of a trawl through the history of Sony and hacking.\nIts battle with hackers began in 2005 when its music division installed software which modified computer operating systems to prevent CDs being copied. It continued in 2010 when Sony took on teenaged hacker George Hotz who jailbroke his PlayStation 3 and released the code.\nIts most high-profile attack happened in April 2011 when hacking group Anonymous launched a campaign to bring down the PlayStation Network. The attackers gaining access to the personal information of more than 77 million users. The hack cost Sony at least $171m.\nAs Chester Wisniewski, a senior security adviser at Sophos, put it in an interview with Gizmodo . &#34;Sony\&#39;s been raising the ire of hackers for as long as I can remember, so you have to think that they\&#39;ve known they\&#39;re a serious target.&#34;\nFor Mr Roberts, the most obvious suspect, like many of the best whodunnits, may be far closer to home.\n&#34;My money is on a disgruntled (possibly ex) employee of Sony,&#34; he concludes.\nWill the case ever make it to court?\nIt is debatable whether those responsible for the attack will ever be brought to justice. The US government has said that, if the hackers do turn out to be North Korean, it will be very difficult to prosecute them.\nAnd while many may speculate on other suspects, hard evidence is proving elusive.\n&#34;The jury is out - North Korea is definitely a suspect. It had opportunity and the means but to convict them you need more evidence,&#34; said security expert from the University of Surrey Prof Alan Woodward.\nWhat everyone does agrees is that the ripple effects from the attack will be felt long after the commentators have stopped asking who is to blame.\nSony Pictures faces a long road to redeeming its reputation and gaining back the trust of Hollywood.\nAmerica faces the hardest of questions about whether, by withdrawing the film, is has given into threats in a way it usually refuses to do.\nAnd the IT bosses of corporations around the world may just as well cancel all their Christmas leave as chief executives demand immediate reviews of their security procedures in a desperate attempt to make sure they never fall foul of similar embarrassing leaks.\nFor Mr Sullivan the hack represents a good moment for corporate America to scrutinise its security arrangements. While it might seem easy to blame a nation state it is time to sit up and acknowledge that this could have happened to any number of firms.\nHe hopes there will be &#34; a decent post-mortem&#34;.\nUntil then though The Most Mysterious Case of the Sony Hack will remain like Charles Dickens\&#39; final novel - The Mystery of Edwin Drood - unfinished.\nMore on This Story\nDid Vladimir Putin gamble on high oil prices lasting for ever?\nMost Popular\n&#39;, u&#39;Asians flock to social networks for shopping sprees\nBy Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani Business Reporter, BBC News, Singapore\nDora\&#39;s become a fashion icon in Singapore influencing young women\&#39;s shopping habits\nCashless in Cape Town\nSingaporean student Dora Soh posts her &#34;outfit of the day&#34; online every day, to connect with fellow fashionistas and inspire her nearly 10,000 followers on Instagram.\nThe 22-year-old\&#39;s shopping habits have become so influential that online retailers are now sponsoring her to wear their clothes, in hopes that her posts will boost their brand and sales.\nOnline retailers sponsoring Dora include Singaporean brands The Tinsel Rack, MGP and Mint &amp; Ooak\n&#34;On social media, I can interact with strangers and share fashion inspiration by following their accounts and liking their photos,&#34; Ms Soh says.\nWhile this sounds like a simple formula to keep up with the latest fashion trends, the avid shopper is at the forefront of a rapidly growing business in Asia - social shopping.\nGlobal retailers are pulling out all the stops to increase their presence on social networks with technology that allows you to broadcast your latest fashion find online, even before it rings through the register.\nFor example, on Singapore-based social network and shopping website clozette.co , users can upload a picture of an item, or focus in on someone else\&#39;s post, and hit search to find similar outfits for sale.\nIt is as exact as narrowing in on nail art on someone\&#39;s finger nails, to search on the website\&#39;s database of two million items from nearly 5,000 global brands.\n&#34;I truly believe we\&#39;re the first company in the world to do that - intelligent visual recognition,&#34; says the website\&#39;s co-founder and chief executive Roger Yuen.\nSocial platforms take off\nMr Yuen says growth has skyrocketed on his social media platform, which allows users to create and share their personal wardrobes, as well as buy and sell items from each other and retailers in Asia.\n&#34;We have close to 400,000 registered members in the region, and as a company we have a reach of about seven million unique users a month,&#34; he says.\nThe firm launched in 2010 with just under 80,000 users in its first year.\nUsers can create their own virtual wardrobes or raid through others\&#39; to find the latest fashion trends\nSingapore based beauty box start-up Vanitytrove.com/sg has also seen tremendous growth since it launched its user content-driven platform earlier this year.\nCo-founder and chief executive Douglas Gan says about 100-150 new members join the website every day, to browse or post about new products, and chat with like-minded beauty experts.\n&#34;We have over 60,000 female members on the platform in Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand,&#34; he says. &#34;We figured that if we want consumers to make a conscious decision before they buy something, we should give them a platform.&#34;\nUsers share makeup tips and beauty product must-haves on Vanitytrove\n\&#39;Word of mouth\&#39;\nRapid growth for such fashion-based social networks is not surprising considering recent figures that showed more and more Asians are turning to social media to shape their shopping habits, outpacing other regions of the world.\nIn a study of 10,000 consumers worldwide, consulting firm AT Kearney found over 95% of people aged between 16 and 45 in China said the chatter on social networks has at some point influenced their online shopping decisions.\nMeanwhile, 61% of Chinese respondents said they &#34;frequently&#34; based purchases on what was happening in their social network - almost double the global average of 32%.\nIn consumer giant India, over 82% of people aged 16-35 said happenings on their social network influenced their buying habits.\nEven among the older generation - those aged 65 and over - more than a quarter said their purchases were frequently influenced by social media - much higher than the global average of 5% for that age group.\nFigures suggest people in Asia use social media to help them decide what to buy more than anywhere else\nTorsten Stocker, Shanghai-based partner at AT Kearney, says word of mouth referrals is the major reason why more Asians rely on social media for shopping, in a world of fake goods and knock-offs.\n&#34;There\&#39;s obviously a history of information control, particularly in China, and I think that extends to some extent to advertising,&#34; he says.\n&#34;I think there\&#39;s also a high prevalence of counterfeit, fake and low quality goods - so that it automatically reduces the trust people have in official communication.&#34;\nTrusting someone who has your best interests in mind, like a close friend or acquaintance, or even someone that is slightly more removed but in your network, is much more compelling, he adds\n&#34;If you look at China in particular, there\&#39;s been so many food scandals, and so many items that may be counterfeit, and may not deliver what they promise. In general the level of trust [in retailers] is lower.&#34;\nAsian consumers look for reassurance when shopping to ensure they are getting authentic merchandise\nRetailers\&#39; virtual push\nAs a result, a lot of consumer goods companies and retailers in Asia are trying to engage with consumers through social media, and create word of mouth in the virtual world.\nRetailers that have been successful in creating a buzz online are using a range of tactics from promising shoppers discounts if they post &#34;selfies&#34; wearing their merchandise, to creating online communities based on competitions or events.\nOutdoor clothing outlet The North Face\&#39;s strategy in China this year gained momentum after it launched a competition for consumers to be &#34;The Next Explorer&#34;, and win a trip to the US.\nThe competition resulted in more than 200,000 new members to its online community, where participants talk about products and connect with each other to organise events such as hiking trips.\nMembers post about adventure trips they have taken on The North Face Chinese website\n&#34;It has taken on a life of its own. North Face is behind it, but it\&#39;s not necessarily advertising for its products,&#34; says Mr Stocker.\n&#34;It\&#39;s made them more visible, and helped create more interest in the category... and hopefully people will buy more products.&#34;\nThe North Face sales in China jumped more than 20% in 2013 from the year before.\nMeanwhile, as retailers try to come up with innovative ways to engage with consumers online, Singaporean online shopper Chelsea Lin says that overall, it is just easier to get more feedback on purchases through social networks versus going into a physical store.\n&#34;It becomes quite addictive, to the point where it\&#39;s a weekly thing that I would buy something,&#34; the 30-year-old office worker says.\n&#34;It\&#39;s like you can shop everyday if you shop online.&#34;\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;The Interview: A guide to the cyber attack on Hollywood\nSony film The Interview has featured highly in hackers\&#39; demands\nA month after hackers launched an attack on Sony Pictures, the fallout has led the Hollywood studio to cancel the release of satirical comedy The Interview, which involves a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.\nThe initial hack, which exposed embarrassing emails and personal details about some of the world\&#39;s biggest movie stars, has escalated after the supposed hackers made threats against cinemas showing the film.\nIt is turning into one of  the most difficult and damaging episodes in recent Hollywood history. Here, we examine the complicated catalogue of events.\nHow did it start?\nOn November 22, there were signs that Sony\&#39;s computer system had been compromised when skulls appeared on employees\&#39; screens with a message threatening to expose &#34;secrets&#34; from data obtained in a sophisticated hack.\nThis initially caused crippling computer problems for workers at Sony, who were forced to work with pen and paper. &#34;We even fired up our fax machine,&#34; one employee told the LA Times.\nSony initially said they were dealing with an &#34;IT matter&#34;, but later acknowledged the hack to staff, calling it a &#34;brazen attack&#34; comprised of &#34;malicious criminal acts&#34;.\nWho is responsible?\nNorth Korean TV denied involvement in the cyber attack\nA unknown group calling itself #GOP - later identified as Guardians of Peace - claimed it was behind the cyber attack , prompting the FBI to launch an investigation. Their name has been attached to subsequent leaks of information.\nSpeculation has since mounted that North Korea may have had a hand in the attack as a form of retaliation for Sony\&#39;s release of The Interview.\nA North Korean foreign ministry spokesman called the movie an &#34;act of terrorism&#34; in June , promising &#34;merciless&#34; retaliation if it was released.\nThe country eventually denied involvement, but heaped praise on the hack, calling it a &#34;righteous deed&#34;. The secretive nation\&#39;s ability to wage cyber warfare is not unknown, but it has not previously used the name Guardians of Peace.\nNews network Bloomberg has reported that the perpetrators worked from a hotel in Thailand, while unnamed Sony executives told TMZ the hackers were helped by insiders who knew where the most embarrassing information could be found. US media quoted anonymous officials as saying that the FBI had linked North Korea to the attacks.\nWhy was the release of The Interview pulled?\nHackers have warned cinemas against screening The Interview\nThe fallout from the hack escalated after the &#34;Guardians of Peace&#34; claimed they would attack cinemas showing the Sony film. They alluded to 9/11 in their message and said it was a response to the &#34;greed of Sony Pictures&#34;.\nThe film\&#39;s New York premiere was cancelled and cinema chains cancelled screenings, leading Sony to announce that it had &#34;decided not to move forward with the planned December 25 theatrical release&#34;.\nHowever the decision has been greeted with incredulity by some in Hollywood.\n&#34;Wow. Everyone caved,&#34; actor Rob Lowe wrote on Twitter . &#34;The hackers won. An utter and complete victory for them. Wow.&#34;\nComedian Jimmy Kimmel tweeted that the decision by theatres to refuse to show the film was &#34;an un-American act of cowardice that validates terrorist actions and sets a terrifying precedent.&#34;\nWhat did the hackers steal?\nAnnie - starring Cameron Diaz - has been leaked as a result of the hack\nBefore the controversy around The Interview, reams of data considered confidential by Sony - and some of the company\&#39;s prime assets - were stolen in the hack.\nAn early version of a script for the next James Bond movie, Spectre, was leaked but failed to halt production.\nFive Sony films, including the new and unreleased version of Annie, turned up on illegal file-sharing sites and were downloaded up to a million times. Brad Pitt\&#39;s Fury, which had already hit cinema screens, was also shared.\nWhat information has been revealed?\nA whole host of Sony\&#39;s private company information has apparently been exposed to the public, including bosses\&#39; salaries and employees\&#39; social security information.\nStrings of confidential emails between Sony workers have also been circulated and proved to be the most sensitive and embarrassing leaks.\nThe emails revealed that:\nFemale film stars including Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence were paid less than their male co-stars.\nSony executive Amy Pascal made jokes about black-themed movies that might be among President Obama\&#39;s favourites.\nAngelina Jolie was branded a &#34;minimally talented spoiled brat&#34; in a private email from producer Scott Rudin.\nGeorge Clooney lost sleep over bad reviews for The Monuments Men and emailed Pascal to say: &#34;I\&#39;ve let you all down. Not my intention. I apologize. I\&#39;ve just lost touch\x85 Who knew?&#34;\nSony has contacted some media outlets asking them to exercise caution over the leaked material they report on.\nHow did Hollywood respond?\nOscar winner Aaron Sorkin has railed against the fall-out of the hack\nA-listers at the heart of the revelations have maintained a dignified silence.\nBut screenwriter and producer Aaron Sorkin wrote in the New York Times of his anger at the hack, accusing the media of aiding and abetting the cyber criminals by sifting through the leaked information and reporting the most salacious findings. He hit out at Hollywood for doing little to protect the dignity of Sony employees, whose personal data has been stolen.\nJames Franco and Seth Rogen, stars of The Interview, have also commented publicly on the hack, using colourful language on US &#34;shock jock&#34; Howard Stern\&#39;s show to refer to the &#34;stolen information&#34;, adding that its circulation is &#34;doing exactly what these criminals want&#34;.\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Media playback is unsupported on your device\nStar Wars and Lord of the Rings in a one man show\n17 December 2014 Last updated at 00:00 GMT\nHe has a strong claim to being the world\&#39;s greatest living geek actor.\nCanadian Charlie Ross has been touring around the globe with his one-man shows of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings for 14 years.\nA self-confessed geek, his big breakthrough came not from a theatre review, but a review in technology blog Slashdot.\nIt brought him to the attention of the &#34;George Lucas family&#34;, who approved of his endeavours, allowing him to play to thousands at Star Wars conventions.\nVideo Journalist: Dougal Shaw\n&#39;, u&#34;Quantum thinking: Cats to computers\nContinue reading the main story\nThis interactive video is a new technology being trialled by the BBC Connected Studio innovation programme and is best viewed with the latest version of Flash.  It does not currently work on iOS or Android mobile devices or tablets. You can find a non-interactive version of the content below.\nContinue reading the main story\nQuantum physics is weird. Things can be in two places at once or spinning in two different directions at the same time.\nWe can normally ignore this absurdity since  it only happens at the microscopic scale.  However, soon machines  that exploit these bizarre features could revolutionise computing.\nConventional computers store and process information as bits. A bit can be a 1 or a 0. A modern computer chip  has millions (even billions) of electronic switches that can either be on to represent 1 or off to represent 0. The progress in computing over the past 70 years has been to shrink and speed up these switches.\nThe Colossus was the first electronic computer - these are valves from a recreation of the 1944 version\nA quantum computer works very differently. Because it uses as its bits tiny particles , either atoms or subatomic particles, these are subject to the laws of quantum physics.\nThat means they can be in two states at the same time, so a quantum bit (or qbit) can be a 1 or a 0 or a 1 and a 0 at the same time.  I will say that again.  A qbit can be both a 1 and a zero at the same time.\nSo why might this revolutionise computing?\nFor all their amazing performance, conventional computers have their limitations. There are some problems so difficult that all the computers that have ever been built could work together and still not find the answer before the sun explodes.\nOptimization\nAs a simple example of the sort of problem we are talking about,  imagine a travelling sales representative.  He or she has to go to 10 different locations in a day and wants to work out which is the most efficient order to make the visits.\nThis is actually a huge mathematical problem, with more than 3.5 million possible combinations that each has to be worked out before the best solution can be reached. Increase the number of locations from 10 to 20 and there are more than two quintillion possible solutions (that&#39;s 2 followed by 18 zeros).\nNow consider not cities, but stars.  There are 300 billion solar systems in our galaxy.  No surprise then that Nasa is very interested in quantum computing.\nThis is an example of what&#39;s called an optimization problem and our world is awash with them.  From designing the right formula for a new drug to trying to get machines to think like humans.\nA quantum computer could crunch this sort of problem pretty swiftly because its qbits are able to consider all the possible answers at the same time and then pick the best answer.\nA D-Wave machine has been installed at Nasa Ames Research Center in California\nSo how close are we to real quantum computers? Canadian company D-Wave will sell you one now.  Although there is a lively debate among physicists as to whether the D-wave machine is really a quantum computer. (That debate is too technical and complex to even attempt to summarise here).\nCloser to home, researchers at Oxford University have succeeded in controlling charged calcium atoms (ions) in a quantum state. At the moment, the apparatus to do this fills a basement.\nShrink this down and add a million or two more qbits and they will have a quantum computer. That, they say, is probably a decade or more away. The physicists involved in this work are very obviously excited to be at the start of a science that could fundamentally change our world.\nNewsnight&#39;s David Grossman explains quantum computers (this video is not interactive)\nInteractive video produced by Laura Mulholland and Dominic Bailey in conjunction with Connected Studios\nMore on This Story\n17 JANUARY 2014, SCIENCE &amp; ENVIRONMENT\nRelated Internet links\n&#34;, u&#39;Virtual galleries open new markets for art\nBy Jane O\&#39;Brien BBC News, Miami\nDoes art make financial sense?\nEvery year in December, Miami Beach becomes the epicentre of the art world. Tens of thousands of people flock to Art Basel where sales of art reportedly top $3bn (\u01411.9bn).\nIn the hyper-party atmosphere billionaires rub shoulders with struggling artists and serious collectors vie with amateurs to spot a potential masterpiece. Thanks to the internet, art has never been more accessible and new markets are opening up around the world.\n&#34;China is a really exciting opportunity for us,&#34; says Carter Cleveland, the 28-year-old founder of Artsy, an online database featuring works by 25,000 artists and more than 2,000 galleries around the world.\nOfficially launched in 2012, Artsy has attracted $26m in funding and has some big name backers such as Paypal cofounder Peter Thiel. The site makes money by charging galleries a monthly subscription to list their art.\nCarter Cleveland, pictured with Wendi Murdoch, Ivanka Trump and Lauren Remington Platt at Art Basel\nThe company has an office in Hong Kong but has yet to establish a presence in mainland China. In an effort to make contacts and pave the way for expansion, Artsy hosted a celebrity bash where the star of the party was Chinese choreographer and artist Shen Wei.\n&#34;China is a lot more challenging because they have their own infrastructure and their own social media and their own search engines,&#34; says Cleveland. &#34;So when you want to expand into mainland China it takes a much more thoughtful approach.&#34;\nChina\&#39;s contemporary art market didn\&#39;t exist much before 2000. It has now overtaken the US, according to Berlin-based Artnet, another online platform that specialises in art auctions. In fact, growth in China appears to be driving the global art industry, which is worth an estimated $66bn.\nUnderscoring the boom in sales, several Chinese galleries staged exhibitions at Art Basel in Miami Beach, including newcomer Beijing Commune. Director Lu Jingjing says the gallery is considering joining Artsy but is still weighing the benefits.\n&#34;Search engines are very well developed too so you have to measure whether it\&#39;s worth the investment,&#34; she says.\nBeijing Commune currently uses WeChat - a mobile messaging app that has 438 million users, mainly in China.\nBeijing Commune director Lu Jingjing is currently weighing her options as to what platforms she uses\n&#34;It\&#39;s not a selling tool like Artsy or Artnet. But you can make your own newsletter about your exhibitions and you know how many people have read it,&#34; says Lu Jingjing.\nHsinke Lee is head of exhibitions at Long March Space, another Chinese gallery at Art Basel. She thinks digital platforms are a &#34;positive&#34; development and predicts they will have a greater role in the Chinese art market.\nShe says many people already buy most things through Taobao, the Chinese equivalent of Amazon, and art is no different.\n&#34;I\&#39;ve noticed a lot of collectors purchase works without viewing them first in person. I myself have clients like that. Even when the work is worth close to a million dollars, they don\&#39;t need to see it,&#34; she says.\nRhonda Long-Sharp learnt from her own experience of buying a Picasso online that turned out to be a fake\nBut the international art market is largely unregulated and other experts warn that buying online poses hazards for the unwary.\n&#34;You\&#39;re only as safe and secure as the ethics of the particular dealer you\&#39;re dealing with,&#34; says Rhonda Long-Sharp, a former lawyer who now owns an eponymous gallery in Indianapolis. She was exhibiting at Scope, another art fair timed to coincide with Art Basel in Miami Beach. Ironically, she switched careers after buying a fake Picasso online.\n&#34;From that I learned a great deal about the art market and the art world,&#34; she says.&#34;When a collector looks online and says he wants a Warhol, he\&#39;s going to find hundreds of galleries that purport to handle Warhol.\n&#34;But you don\&#39;t know if they\&#39;re a legitimate gallery, you don\&#39;t know if the piece is authentic and you don\&#39;t know if the condition is outstanding or if it\&#39;s been restored so much that the value is really a smidgen of what it should be.&#34;\nNevertheless, she pays Artnet &#34;a fair amount of money&#34; for a gallery page. She says it is an important marketing tool for Long-Sharp Gallery and good for collectors who want to learn more about a piece.\n&#34;Online impacts fairs like this because if you see something here that you like you can go online and look at other works by the artist. People often come here with their cameras, snap a shot of the piece and snap a shot of the name tag. You\&#39;ll hear from them maybe two months later.&#34;\nFar from competing with physical fairs such as Art Basel, digital and social media have become an integral part of the event. In addition to 73,000 visitors, Art Basel Miami has 300,000 Facebook followers, 150,000 Twitter followers and 100,000 on Instagram.\nOrganisers also tapped into that online community to launch a crowdfunding campaign for non-profit art organisations that generally don\&#39;t attract major investment but are seen as essential incubators for emerging talent.\nBig businesses are also entering the digital art world. The Swiss bank UBS, a major sponsor of Art Basel, hopes to meet the surging demand for information with the launch of Planet Art, an app that aggregates news about contemporary art.\nPeter Dillon, head of global art platforms at UBS, says it cuts through the clutter in a complicated market. &#34;It expands access to the art world and the art market. For somebody who is new to it, this is a great way to get real-time information,&#34; he says.\n&#34;It\&#39;s data led so it\&#39;s objective. It\&#39;s based on an algorithm that uses the facts in articles to index and organise them. It\&#39;s applying a skill set that we have as a bank to the art world.&#34;\nBut although UBS has a massive corporate art collection, Dillon says the bank does not advise clients on buying art as an investment. A sentiment echoed by Art Basel director Marc Spiegler.\n&#34;The whole issue of art as an investment makes me somewhat queasy,&#34; he says. &#34;A lot of people have tried to do art funds, almost all of them have failed. Historically the collections that appreciated the most are the ones that went against the market. There is always a speculative market, there\&#39;s always a bubble - but it\&#39;s small.\n&#34;Our fair is not about monetising mini-bubbles; our fair is about building a sustainable support base for the careers of artists and their galleries. I think people should buy work that they like.&#34;\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Taking stock: Tech to thwart retail\&#39;s worst miscreants\nBy Ian Hardy Technology reporter, New York\nRebecca Minkoff is a very busy woman. And like all successful fashion designers she likes to be at least a few steps ahead of the rest of us.\nChristmas shopping gets tech boost\nSo it\&#39;s not surprising her first flagship store - in the heart of Soho, New York City - is a cleverly concealed mix of bricks and bandwidth.\nA partnership with eBay means that shoppers can log on in the shop via a giant interactive screen, to make a wish list of items.\nOnce in the changing room, the shopper can also communicate digitally with tablet-carrying sales associates, who then bring over requested clothes in different sizes and colours.\nOnce a decision has been made the guest can then pay for merchandise without ever standing in a queue or seeing a cash register.\nRebecca loves the idea of providing her customers with a physical shopping experience that brings with it all the best bits from an online world that her younger customers crave.\nBut as it turns out her new way of doing business might also help solve a major problem that plagues a lot of high street business owners - theft.\nThe high tech fitting rooms serving clients at Rebecca Minkoff\&#39;s New York boutique\nSales assistants can check stock status from their tablets while on the shop floor\nTag it\nTo enable the customer care aspect of her boutique, every item has an RFID (radio frequency identification) chip embedded in the price tag.\nSo the in-store system can track the location of every shoe, skirt and handbag within the four walls, including the row of changing rooms which have been painted with a special surface to prevent radio signals becoming cross contaminated.\nOf course, currently anyone can decapitate a tag in seconds, but Ms Minkoff says the shop is just one step away from a foolproof method of preventing &#34;shrinkage&#34;,  as the loss of products is known in retailing.\n&#34;Today, they could [walk out of the door with the item] because there is a [removable] tag on this, but our next goal once a back end issue is solved, is embedding them in the clothes, bags and shoes and it will become a security device,&#34; she says.\nEach price tag has an RFID tag embedded in it, making the items easy to track\nRebecca Minkoff in her New York shop\nAnother problem in the fashion world and retailing as a whole is fraudulent returns.\nOnly 1% of shoppers do it, but it added up to $16.3bn in the US alone in 2013 according to the National Retail Federation (NRF). And it\&#39;s getting worse.\nOne trick known as &#34;wardrobing&#34;, played out countless times especially around this time of year, is to buy a cocktail dress, wear it once, look absolutely stunning for a couple of hours, then return it the next day.\nSo now lots of shops put the tag in a prominent position on the garment that\&#39;s super inconvenient for anyone to hide when taking the dress to a one-and-done style event.\nManagers are also getting stricter about their return policies. Accidentally rip the tag off or lose the receipt? Too bad.\nWe are watching\nThat of course is a pretty low tech solution.\nThat\&#39;s where The Retail Equation (TRE) comes in.\nIt is not an organisation that US shoppers know much about, except maybe &#34;returnaholics&#34;, and its clients are kept top secret.\nBut the way it works is that a network of shops share information about people who mimic the behaviour of &#34;serial returners&#34;.\nThese are people who may, for example, buy a top-of-the-line TV just before the Superbowl and keep it for less than 24 hours every year.\nBuying a high-end TV the day before the Superbowl and returning within 24 hours is seen as suspicious\nThe information collected from individuals may vary from state to state, and the return policies differ from shop to shop, so a sophisticated algorithm is needed to identify possible abuses.\nTom Rittman, vice president of marketing for The Retail Equation, points out that a refused return is therefore an objective result made by a computer, allowing even the most subjective cashier to be removed from the decision making process.\n&#34;The factors that Verify-3 (the name of the system) may use for a given retailer include the frequency of returns, return dollar amounts, whether the return is receipted or non-receipted and purchase history,&#34; he says.\n&#34;Verify does not use other factors in authorising returns such as age, gender, race, nationality, physical characteristics or marital status.&#34;\nFaking it\nAnother enterprise where a complete crackdown has long seemed elusive is the art of counterfeiting.\nBut in a few years it\&#39;s possible that many products, especially high end ones, will feature a logo or pattern created using nanotechnology.\nThe particles that make up the patterns are held in place by the surface tension of water\nThe images are made up of thousands and thousands of tiny dots\nFluorescent spheres which give out red, blue and green light can also be used to create patterns\nThe result is impossible to see with the naked eye, as it\&#39;s a tiny fraction of the size of a pin head.\nThe logo or design is stamped onto a surface such as paper, glass, metal or precious stones in such a way that particles are held in place by the natural surface tension of water.\nDr Heiko Wolf at IBM Research in Zurich\nFluorescent spheres which give out red, blue and green light can also be used to create patterns.\nDr Heiko Wolf, a physicist at IBM Research in Zurich, claims it would be daunting for even the cleverest counterfeiter to replicate the technology.\nThat pleases many high end manufacturers, who are constantly on the look out for ways to hold on to their intellectual property.\n&#34;Yes, several have been in touch, in most cases they need the technique to print faster, which requires more research and investment,&#34; he says.\n&#34;The other challenge for them is how they can read the nano patterns at a retail location or at customs controls, so they would need to invest in optical detection instruments.&#34;\nSome companies have high hopes for the technology after seeing 3D holograms and an endless array of other anti counterfeit measures beaten over time.\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Sonia Gandhi in hospital after infection\nSonia Gandhi was the de facto head of the government during the Congress party\&#39;s term in office\nGandhi resumes work after surgery\nLeader of India\&#39;s main opposition Congress party Sonia Gandhi is in hospital for treatment of an infection.\nMrs Gandhi was admitted to Delhi\&#39;s Ganga Ram Hospital on Friday evening, Press Trust of India news agency quoted party spokesman Ajay Maken as saying.\nIn 2011 Mrs Gandhi went to the US to receive surgery for an undisclosed medical condition.\nLast year, she was taken to a Delhi hospital for a few hours after she fell ill during a debate in the parliament.\nMrs Gandhi was suffering from a respiratory tract infection and her condition is now stable, party officials said.\n&#34;She is currently under observation,&#34; a Congress spokesman told AFP news agency.\nMrs Gandhi, 68, is the widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.\nShe is the head of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, which has ruled India for most of the time since independence in 1947.\nHer party lost the 2014 general elections to the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.\nMore on This Story\n04 AUGUST 2011, SOUTH ASIA\nFrom other news sites\n&#39;, u&#39;Mumbai attacks \&#39;mastermind\&#39; Lakhvi bailed in Pakistan\nThe attacks in Mumbai lasted almost 60 hours, and saw numerous public buildings and locations attacked.\nUS bounty for Pakistan hardliner\nA man accused of masterminding the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks has been granted bail by a court in Pakistan.\nZaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi is one of seven men facing trial over the attacks in the Indian city, which left 165 people dead. Nine gunmen were also killed.\nThe attacks in Mumbai damaged peace efforts between India and Pakistan.\nThe bailing of Mr Lakhvi came a day after Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif vowed to end terrorism after the Taliban killed 141 people at a school in Peshawar.\nCorrespondents say the move will be an embarrassment for the Pakistani authorities who are under pressure to bring suspects in the case to justice.\nZaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and his co-accused were arrested in 2008 and had filed bail applications on 10 December.\nIt remains unclear on what grounds the court ordered Mr Lakhvi\&#39;s bail.\nThe attacks in Mumbai were blamed on the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, and Mr Lakhvi was accused of heading the group.\nAnother man, Zarar Shah, has been accused of working with him, and was arrested in Pakistani-administered Kashmir in December 2008, but his name does not appear alongside those being tried with Mr Lakhvi.\nNine other men have been also charged in absentia in relation to the attacks.\nMr Lakhvi has been in Pakistani custody since 2008.\nMr Lakhvi was directed to pay surety bonds worth 1m rupees (\u01416,400) before being released, his lawyer told  Reuters.\nThe lawyer, Raja Rizwan Abbasi, told the PTI news agency that bail had been granted because the &#34;evidence against Lakhvi was deficient&#34;.\nProsecutors are considering whether to challenge the ruling.\nIndia, which provided intelligence intercepts which it said proved Laskhar-e Taiba\&#39;s involvement in the attack, was swift to criticise Mr Lakhvi\&#39;s release.\nHome Minister Rajnath Singh described the granting of bail as &#34;very unfortunate&#34;.\nHe said: &#34;I believe it should not have happened... [The] Pakistan government must appeal against the order at the earliest.&#34;\nCorrespondents say the charges brought against Mr Lakhvi and other suspects held in Pakistan were mainly based on a confession given by the only gunman captured alive after the attacks.\nMohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab was executed in 2012.\nMore on This Story\n27 NOVEMBER 2008, SOUTH ASIA\nShare this page\nDid Vladimir Putin gamble on high oil prices lasting for ever?\nMost Popular\n&#39;, u&#39;India launches largest rocket and unmanned capsule\nFootage shows the launch of India\&#39;s most powerful rocket\nIndia launches cryogenic rocket Watch\nIndia has successfully launched its largest rocket and an unmanned capsule which could send astronauts into space.\nThe 630-tonne Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (MK III) blasted off from Sriharikota in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh on Thursday morning.\nThe new rocket will be able to carry heavier satellites into space.\nIndia has successfully launched lighter satellites in recent years, but has faced problems sending up heavier payloads.\nThe new rocket is capable of carrying communication satellites weighing 4,000kg, reports say, meaning India will not have to rely on foreign launchers to do so.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted after the launch: &#34;Successful launch of GSLV MK-III is yet another triumph of brilliance &amp; hard work of our scientists.

Across the border, in Pakistan, floods and house collapses have left more than 180 people dead.\nFive days of heavy rain abated over the weekend, but flood waters in Srinagar have risen dramatically. The Jhelum river has flooded large parts of the city and forced residents onto rooftops.\nResidents have waded through neck-deep waters with their belongings.  Kashmir\&#39;s Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the floods were &#34;unprecedented&#34; but urged residents not to panic, saying rescuers would eventually reach them.\nA police official in Srinagar told the AFP news agency that he feared the extent of the devastation was not yet known because phone networks were down and areas cut off.

Arindam Mukherjee photographs some coal miners going about their work in eastern India.\nThe coal-rich region in India includes huge swathes of eastern states like Orissa, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh, and pockets in the central and southern parts of the country.\nMost miners spend their days tunnelling, digging and extracting coal from the mines. Here, a group of miners are at work in a mine in West Bengal state&#39;s Raniganj district. Each group is led by a sardar (chief) who is responsible for the work of his group.\nMore than half of India&#39;s commercial energy needs are met by coal. It is the main fuel for generating power and making steel and cement. But mining is also a major factor in environment pollution, emitting smoke and noxious gases.\nMany of the miners also suffer from lung diseases caused due to inhaling coal dust throughout the day.\nCoal mining can be a very hazardous activity and hundreds of miners have died over the years in accidents in mines.\nPoor maintenance of the mines is a major factor behind frequent accidents. Once underground, the only way a miner can communicate with the outside world is by using an intercom.\nSunita Devi&#39;s husband Santraj Prasad was killed along with 25 others in February 2001 when the Bagdigi colliery in Jharkhand was flooded. She now works as a guard at a mine officer&#39;s bungalow in the nearby town of Jharia. Here, she sits at her home with her late husband&#39;s photograph and one of her children.\nMiner Salim Ansari was the lone survivor of the Bagdigi disaster in which 26 of his colleagues died. He was trapped in an underground air pocket for seven days until rescue workers found him and brought him out.\nLakhan Tanti works as a loader at the government-owned Coal India Limited mine in Ranigunj in West Bengal. He says the company is now hiring contractual labourers instead of salaried employees to cut costs.\nCoal mines, like this one in the state of Jharkhand, have multiple floors where excavation takes place and often operate 24 hours a day. Here, a group of miners are going deep inside an underground mine to begin work.\nFemale labourers are hired to clean and collect coal near the railway line in Bailbandh colliery in Ranigunj. The women are mostly dependents of deceased miners and are employed on humanitarian grounds after the death of their husbands.\nShare this page\n&#34;, u&#34;2 October 2013 Last updated at 00:26\nIn pictures: India&#39;s Ambassador taxis\nShare this page\nChristmas photographs of Prince George\nServices\nBBC \u0160 2014 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Ambar was known for taking on the powerful Mughal rulers of northern India.\nAn exhibition, organised by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture of The New York Public Library, in Delhi recently showcased such &#34;forgotten&#34; stories of Africa\&#39;s role in India\&#39;s history.\nAbyssinians, also known as Habshis in India, mostly came from the Horn of Africa to the subcontinent. Dr Sylviane A Diouf of the Schomburg Center says Africans were successful in India because of their military prowess and administrative skills.\n&#34;African men were employed in very specialised jobs, as soldiers, palace guards, or bodyguards; they were able to rise through the ranks becoming generals, admirals, and administrators,&#34; she says.\nKenneth Robbins, co-curator of the exhibition, says it is very important for Indians to know that Africans were an integral part of several Indian sultanates and some of them even started their own dynasties.\n&#34;Early evidence suggests that Africans came to India as early as the 4th Century. But they really flourished as traders, artists, rulers, architects and reformers between the 14th Century and 17th Century,&#34; he says.\nThis 17th-Century cloth painting depicts a procession of Deccani sultan Abdullah Qutb Shah. African guards are seen here as part of the sultan\&#39;s army.\nApart from the Deccan sultanates in southern India, Africans also rose to prominence on the western coast of India. Some of them brought their traditional music and Sufi Islam with them.\nMr Robbins says Deccan sultans relied on African soldiers because Mughal rulers of northern India did not allow them to recruit men from Afghanistan and other central Asian countries.\nThis 1887 painting from Kutch portrays the Sidi Damal, a religious, ecstatic dance form of the Muslim Sidis who were brought to India from East Africa.\nDr Diouf says Indian rulers trusted Africans and their skills. &#34;It was true, especially in areas where hereditary authority was weak and there was ongoing instability due to struggles between factions like in the Deccan,&#34; she says.\n&#34;Africans sometimes did seize power for their group like they did in Bengal - where they were known as the Abyssinian Party - in the 1480s; or in Janjira and Sachin (on the western coast of India) where they established African dynasties. They also took power on an individual basis, as Sidi Masud did in Adoni (in southern India) or Malik Ambar in Ahmadnagar (in western India),&#34; she adds.\nThe funerary complex shown in the photograph above was also designed by eunuch Malik Sandal after 1597 in Bijapur (in present-day southern Karnataka state).\nThis painting from 1590 shows an Indian prince eating in the land of Ethiopians (Habshi) or East Africans (Zangis).\nAfricans also brought their music to India. This artwork dated 1640-1660 shows a player of the African lyre.\nIn this 1904 photo taken in Hyderabad in the Deccan region, Africans guards are seen escorting a royal procession.\nThe most celebrated of the powerful Ethiopian leaders in India was Malik Ambar (1548-1626). His mausoleum still exists in Khuldabad, near Aurangabad district in western India.\nThis painting shows Nawab Sidi Haidar Khan of Sachin. The African-ruled state of Sachin was established in 1791 in Gujarat. It had its own cavalry and a state band that included Africans, its own coats of arms, currency, and stamped paper. In 1948, when the princely states were incorporated into independent India and ceased to exist, Sachin had a population of 26,000 - 85% Hindu and 13% Muslim - explains Dr Diouf.\nThe main African figures of the past have not been forgotten but their ethnicity has been erased, consciously or not, she adds.\n&#34;The people who have heard of Malik Ambar, for example, generally do not know he was Ethiopian. Does it mean that these men\&#39;s origin was so irrelevant that it was useless to mention it, or is this historical erasure the product of a conscious denial of the African contribution?&#34; she asks.\nShare this page\n&#39;, u&#39;Indian official\&#39;s rage over road works becomes an online hit\nBy BBC Trending What\&#39;s popular and why\nThe internet\&#39;s \&#39;bling ring\&#39; exposed Watch\nA district magistrate scolding civic officials and contractors for what she says is shoddy road construction has become an online hit.\nAlmost a million people have viewed the footage of B Chandrakala, the District Magistrate of Bulandhshahr, giving the group of men a dressing down since it was posted on Facebook yesterday.\n&#34;So much money is coming from the government, but can you see even one developmental work in the city?&#34; she says on the video.\nOne of the people she\&#39;s addressing protests, but Chandrakala is quick to respond: &#34;Is this the work that is happening? Hit two bricks together and it\&#39;s over. Is this your work?\n&#34;Have some shame,&#34; she continues. &#34;This is the public\&#39;s money.&#34;\n&#34;We need Officers like this in India!&#34; is the title of the video posted on YouTube , and her performance has been applauded by many viewers.\n&#34;Its a shame that we have to be proud of people when they do their job,&#34; commented Munish Nainani on Facebook: &#34;Goes to show how far the other bureaucrats have fallen who just don\&#39;t do their job.&#34;\n&#34;This is a perfect example to those who think \&#39;what will happen when u give power to a women\&#39;,&#34; commented Sunny Sengupta on Facebook. &#34;This is what happens when u give power to a women ... they have the guts to stand up against corruption ... ma\&#39;am a salute to u.&#34;\nB Chandrakala told BBC Trending she was on a routine inspection of Bulandhshahr\&#39;s roads following complaints about the quality of some of the works, and hadn\&#39;t arranged for the filming to take place.\nRahul Goel, editor of local news website Bulandshahr Express, was one of the first people to post the video on the day the events took place, 11 December.\n&#34;The road in question has been constructed and damaged three times already,&#34; Goel told BBC Trending. &#34;The road was constructed at night and it would fall apart the next day. Then, it would be constructed again and, again, fall apart. This has happened three times now and people complained.\n&#34;We also shared the video on WhatsApp and it went viral in the city. They are hopeful about progress for the first time - they have never seen an official like this before.&#34;\nThe poor standard of road construction is a commonly-heard complaint in India.\nReporting by Samiha Nettikkara\nYou can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending\nAll our stories are at bbc.com/trending\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Atul Gawande: What ails India\&#39;s public health system\nAtul Gawande is an expert on medical error and performance\nRelated Stories\nHarvard doctor is Reith lecturer\nWhat do you make of India\&#39;s under-performing, poorly-funded, leaky public health system, smothered by high population and appalling sanitation?\nIt is the same health system, by the way, which has helped raise life expectancy from 32 years a few decades ago, to more than 65 today.\nWhat do you make of a health system which pulls off the remarkable feat of eradicating polio - India was home to four-fifths of the world\&#39;s polio cases in 2002 - in a decade, but where women continue to die delivering babies and during simple sterilisation surgeries?\nSo does India\&#39;s health system - like many other things in the country - do the big things well and fare badly in executing the relatively smaller ones?\nSurgeon and writer Atul Gawande, who loves grappling with such gruelling questions, believes India\&#39;s public health system is one of the &#34;most complex things&#34; in the world.\nAnd then, in a calm and measured tone, he proceeds to tell you a personal story to illustrate public health\&#39;s chequered journey in the world\&#39;s second most populous nation.\nThis is a country, he tells me, where his grandmother died of malaria before the age of 30, at a time when she had no access to malaria drugs that were then becoming available.  His grandfather, however, lived to the ripe age of 110, in the same village in Maharashtra. His aunts didn\&#39;t die until into their nineties.\n&#34;Simple things like clean water, more irrigation, more crops, more affluence added years to people\&#39;s lives here. Public health, sanitation and antibiotics also helped,&#34; he says.\nBut with Indians living longer, their needs have become wider. A health system designed primarily for infectious diseases was finding it difficult to cope with a new and more complicated swathe of illnesses - from high blood pressure to diabetes.\n&#34;The top killer in India is death from cardio-vascular diseases . We are still in an economy with an infrastructure which has not progressed yet to meet the needs of someone who comes in with a heart attack, requires an operation, and wants it be done safely and well,&#34; he says.\nIndia has some of the best doctors in the world, says Dr Gawande\nDr Gawande, the son of immigrants from India, wears many hats.\nIn the operating theatre, he practises general and endocrine surgery . In the medical school lecture theatre, he teaches health policy and management.\nOutside, he is a writer of best-selling books, mostly riveting essays on the challenges and tricky ethical issues facing modern medicine and about doctors and their mistakes. His recent book, Being Mortal , is an exquisitely crafted and courageous meditation on ageing and death and how doctors can help patients deal with end of life.\n&#34;Polio was a big thing, and India made it a small thing,&#34; says Dr Gawande, 48, who was in Delhi last week to deliver the last of this year\&#39;s BBC Reith Lectures. &#34;They got the basics right.&#34;\nAuthorities got the vaccine, kept it cold, and made sure volunteers go house to house, village after village, and offer vaccines and track and monitor the vaccination drive. How did India even make this happen?\n&#34;Well, India was being very systematic. There was a clear message that we have a goal, we are in it together to eliminate the disease. I actually learnt the checklist idea by touring with a WHO [World Health Organization] polio eradication team in Andhra Pradesh,&#34; says Dr Gawande. The result was his book The Checklist Manifesto: How To Get Things Right , an old-fashioned, nine-chapter checklist primer for doctors to cut complications, infections and hospital deaths.\n&#34;Eradicating polio took over a decade. One of my favourite sayings is by Bill Gates: \&#39;We overestimate what we can accomplish in two years, but we underestimate what we can accomplish in 10.\&#39;&#34;\nBut on the flip side, many lives are still lost during simple surgeries and treatments, something which Dr Gawande puts down to a &#34;functional failure in the organisation and operation in how our [Indian] systems work&#34;.\nThe sterilisation deaths in Chhattisgarh were a reminder of India\&#39;s weak public health system\n&#34;You have very good people with a lot of experience and good training in India. But if you put some of your best and smartest people in dysfunctional systems, it\&#39;s demoralising for them and it is unsafe for the others. The easy thing to say is that this is a bad doctor and he will be punished and that will solve the problem. But we all know that it is not the case,&#34; he says.\nThe death of 15 women at two state-run sterilisation camps in Chhattisgarh last month is a painful reminder of how India is not getting its essential public health care checklist in order - poor hygiene and contaminated drugs have been blamed.\n&#34;The Chhattisgarh incident may be the result of contaminated drugs and production chains along the way, and it just goes to show how complex the system is. Having a great doctor only gets you so far if you are not building the checks and the system for how our drugs, or devices, even our cleaning of the operating rooms and the hospitals, how the basic hygiene is done,&#34; says Dr Gawande.\nWe talk about his new and most compelling work so far on mortality, and about building a health care system that will &#34;actually help people achieve what\&#39;s most important to them at the end of their lives&#34;.\nIndia, says Dr Gawande, is going through a &#34;remarkable transformation&#34; that reflects the breakdown of the family that comes with economic progress, as evident by the rise of retirement complexes and old age homes.

Ms Sharan explains to the drivers what actions could be considered sexual harassment.\nSince the Uber case, the transport department in Delhi has made the gender sensitisation classes mandatory for taxi drivers as well as auto-rickshaw drivers. Mental health charity Manas is helping with the training, which is set to begin on 22 December, a spokesperson for Manas told the BBC.\nThere has been increased focus on the issue of women\&#39;s safety and crimes against women since the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a bus in Delhi two years ago. Global outrage forced India\&#39;s government to introduce tough new anti-rape laws, but crimes against women continue unabated in Delhi and the rest of the country - according to the National Crime Records Bureau, one rape is reported every 16 minutes.\nIn recent months, some cities like Cochin in the southern state of Kerala have launched taxi services with female drivers - &#34;She Taxi&#34; - to provide safe transportation to women passengers. &#34;She Taxis&#34; is a fleet of 40 taxis run &#34;by women, for women&#34; and is fitted with wireless tracking gear and panic buttons linked to call centres.\nCampaigners, however, say gender segregation is not the answer and that women\&#39;s safety can be achieved only by changing societal attitudes and making men respect women.

But there were other issues that gripped the Indian public this week. Several of these stories came from the south of the country. BBC Tamil\&#39;s Jagadheesan Leklapoodi takes a look.\nRajnikanth mania\nThis week has seen Tamil audiences in a frenzy over superstar actor Rajnikanth\&#39;s new film Lingaa, released the day he turned 64.\nEven Vodafone India tweeted: &#34;It\&#39;s International cake-eating day. Why? Cos it\&#39;s Rajinikanth\&#39;s Birthday! Let\&#39;s celebrate by listening to his playlist&#34;\nBut it was not a week without controversy. A young film critic, known as Arun,  in Tamil Nadu, says his Facebook account was blocked after the company received thousands of complaints when he criticised Rajnikanth.  Facebook did not respond to a request for a comment from BBC Tamil but Arun says they told him about the complaints and said that his name on Facebook - Arun Tamilstudio - represents a company rather than an individual.\nHe now has a Facebook page rather than a personal account, but says the incident was an indication of the ability of Rajnikanth fans to silence the critics.\n#StopMethaneExplorationInKaveriDelta\nAmid the furore over the rape and then the ban on Uber, a rather curious unexpected trend emerged. That was that the opposition to the project to extract methane gas in the Cauvery Delta in southern India was getting a lot of traction.\nThis is an old dispute. Yet it found its way onto Twitter, presumably because of concerted campaigning activity.  There have been more than 50,000 straight tweets using the above hashtag.\nIt\&#39;s all about a project which aims to extract the gas using hydraulic fracturing in the Cauvery river basin in Tamil Nadu and is opposed by activists, farmers and environmentalists. The operation never got under way and was suspended by the government.\nThe Cauvery river originates in Karnataka and flows into Tamil Nadu. There is also a long-standing dispute  between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over sharing its waters, dating back to the early part of the 20th Century.\nGuess who?

The stencils are a clever mash-up of Western pop culture with Indian icons, and the artist&#39;s (or artists&#39;) style is certainly influenced by that anonymous yet famous British street artist, Banksy .\nGuesswho spoke to BBC Tamil and BBC Trending: he or she wouldn&#39;t reveal their identity to us, but they did agree to answer some questions via email.\nWhat can you tell us about yourself? Are you one artist or several? Male or female?\nSomebody who likes graffiti.\nDo you have a political point?  What&#39;s your message?\nI don&#39;t believe it is art&#39;s purpose to send any message. It was mainly an alternative way to use a visual language that people are unfamiliar with here. But at the same time they can connect and communicate with the image and subject while being subtly political. It is also about using public spaces and subversive tactics as potent means of speaking about social realities.\nThe superheroes and Shikari Shambu with Appi Hippi (a character from a cartoon strip) pieces were done in response to the Kiss of Love campaign that has been going on here.  [BBC Trending previously covered the debate over &#39;immoral acts&#39; in public ] People who were coming on to the streets to kiss and protest are being arrested. But what if fictional characters do the same? Do they arrest them too?\nWhat are you hoping to achieve?\nUnfortunately we don&#39;t have a culture of graffiti here [in India] and there aren&#39;t many artists who choose to depart from the hierarchies and definitions imposed by the traditional art institutions. It&#39;s an effort as a visual artist to start looking for new and meaningful ways to engage a wider audience and inspire more people to take up this as a powerful medium of free expression.\nWhat reaction have you got?\nAbsolutely amazing so far. Totally unexpected to be honest. Never thought people who don&#39;t otherwise care about art and stuff would start talking about it. It certainly seems to have created an interest and opened up doors.\nWhat kind of risks are you taking - what would happen if you get caught?\nAs long as the images and subjects aren&#39;t very provocative and explicit in nature, which is the case now, it should be ok. But the day it becomes otherwise, it could be a problem and one could land in serious trouble.\nGraffiti&#39;s against the law. What do you say to people who argue it&#39;s just vandalism?\nWhy just point your fingers at graffiti? We live in a visually polluted place. The streets and walls are flooded with movie posters, advertisements, election campaign signs and notices. Are those against the law? Can those also be called vandalism?\nGuesswho says: &#39;On the day India successfully sent a spacecraft into orbit around Mars, a tweet with a picture of female scientists celebrating was an inspiration.&#39;\nDo you really think you can keep your identity secret? The Times of India reported that they guessed who you were and rang you.\nIt is not a question about if one wants to keep the identity a secret, but whether others would understand the reasons behind that and respect it.\nWhat are your future plans - do you plan to post artwork beyond Kochi?  Tackle different subjects? Hang your work in art galleries?\nI would certainly love to expand, explore new cultures and do works that are relevant to the cultural characteristics and landscapes of each place. Yes, there are a few things in the pipeline. An alternate medium like graffiti finding a place in a mainstream gallery space would be a very interesting thing to see, but that isn&#39;t something new in the West though.\nYou made a route map of your graffiti in Kochi. Have any of the works been whitewashed yet?\nYes, some of them have been. But isn&#39;t it the characteristics of this medium and taken as part of the process?\nFinally, do you mind being compared to Banksy?\nThat would be too much of a compliment ... He has been in the business for decades and has very high standards that not many can catch up to. But of course, as a new kid in the block, would certainly love to know about his thoughts on these works and hope to meet him one day.\nGuesswho says: &#39;Re-imagining popular and iconic images is not really a new tradition in street art. But to use it with reference to the cultural characteristics of the location was the key. The public need to see more unconventional portrayals of women. &#39;\nA modern retake of a famous painting by Ravi Varma.

They bring their own food.\nThe tribespeople stand uninterruptedly for nearly 11 hours every day outside the office even as ministers and officials pass them by.\nWriters, filmmakers and some political leaders drop in to pledge support. Some donate money; others sing revolutionary songs.\n&#34;Many more are willing to come but we are restricting the number to avoid inconvenience to the people,&#34; protest leader CK Janu says.\nStellar record\nAt the root of the demonstration is a long and arduous battle that Ms Janu and her fellow travellers have fought for their fundamental rights.\nBy Indian standards, Kerala has a stellar record in land reform - distributing land to the landless - but it appears to have bypassed its tribespeople.\nThe tribespeople say they were promised land - ranging from one to five acres per family - by a previous Congress party-led government headed by former chief minister AK Antony after they waged a 48-day-long protest in 2001.\nMs Janu says the number of landless tribal families has now  grown to about 75,000 - up from 35,000 during the 2001 protest when the government promised to allocate 12,000 acres of land for their rehabilitation.\nMs Janu says the tribespeople want to live with dignity\nOutsiders sometimes join the protest singing songs in solidarity\nWhen the government failed to keep its promise, Ms Janu led more than 1,000 tribespeople in 2003 to illegally occupy a wildlife sanctuary in Wayanad district.\nArmed police and wildlife officials took two days to clear the sanctuary. A tribal and a policeman were killed in pitched battles and police firing.\n\&#39;Without a break\&#39;\nKerala\&#39;s minister for tribespeople PK Jayalakshmi says the government has met most of the protesters\&#39; demands.\nThe government has so far been able to provide more than 9,000 acres of land to 6,887 families and plans are afoot to give land to another 417 families soon.\n&#34;Land is being distributed as per its availability.  It is a continuing process,&#34; Ms Jayalakshmi says.\nBut Ms Janu is not convinced.\n&#34;There\&#39;s no water, power and other infrastructure where land has been given to us. Most of the land is not cultivable. Officials are not visiting their new villages in the forests and seeing the conditions our people are living in,&#34; she says.\n&#34;The government should have done its homework properly before the 2001 agreement. We want to live with dignity.&#34;\nThe protesters mainly live in the three districts of Wayanad, Idukki and Palakkad and, reports say, in recent years, a number of infants have died due to malnutrition and local women have been sexually abused in the tribal settlements by outsiders.\nThey say it is not easy fighting for your rights standing up the whole day.\nTwenty-one-year-old Vineetha\&#39;s family received an acre of land but, she says, the land cannot be cultivated and is often trampled over by marauding elephants and wild boars in the northern district of Kannur.\nNow she participates in the protest every day, with her 42-year-old mother Kamala.\n&#34;I have developed body pain and swollen feel as I come here every day and stand without a break,&#34; she says.\nBut she is not willing to give up fighting: &#34;My mother and I are prepared to die here. We will not go back until our demands are met.&#34;\nMore on This Story\n21 FEBRUARY 2003, SOUTH ASIA\nShare this page\nDid Vladimir Putin gamble on high oil prices lasting for ever?\nMost Popular\n&#39;, u&#39;Why segregated housing is thriving in India\nRizwan Kadri moved into a Muslim apartment building from a mixed neighbourhood\nRizwan Kadri runs an architecture firm with three partners, all Hindus, in India\&#39;s western city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat state.\nSon of a revenue official, he grew up in mixed neighbourhoods.  In 2002, massive anti-Muslim riots sparked by the burning of a train carrying Hindu pilgrims, left more than 1,000 people dead in Gujarat.\nA few months before the riots, Mr Kadri moved out with his wife and son from a mixed neighbourhood where he had lived for 24 years to a Muslim apartment building in Juhapura, one of India\&#39;s largest Muslim ghettos , on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.\nA year later, his ageing parents joined them. &#34;The move was prompted by concerns over safety more than anything else,&#34; says Mr Kadri.\nAhmedabad, the main city of Gujarat, which was ruled by the new PM Narendra Modi for more than a decade, is among the many Indian cities where segregated housing is alive and well.\nA range of old reasons like caste and cultural differences - and some relatively new ones such as migration and religious tensions - have led to a proliferation of what urban sociologist Loic Wacquant , referring to ghettos in French and American cities, has described as &#34;neighbourhoods of exile&#34;.\nJuhapura, an obscure village-turned-ghetto of some 400,000 Muslims, is one such neighbourhood of exile.\nThe heart of this dystopian sprawl is clogged with narrow lanes, tumbledown tenements, overflowing sewers and rubbish mountains. Public transport stays away from the neighbourhood. The wider streets are lined by a rash of new high-rise gated Muslim properties costing up to 6 million rupees (\u014162,000). A forthcoming gated 14-storey property with some 800 apartments promises a mall, club, separate gyms for men and women, prayer rooms and mosque.\nGhettos are also a great leveller: the stench of rubbish wafts from the grubby low-slung tenements to Mr Kadri\&#39;s apartment just a mile away, the air is polluted, and the streets are bumpy and pockmarked.\nJuhapura is one of India\&#39;s biggest Muslim ghettos\nThe wider streets in Juhapura are lined by upmarket Muslim apartments...\n...while poorer Muslims live in small apartments in the ghetto\&#39;s congested lanes\nSegregation has inevitably led to curious business opportunities. Sensing that mixed neighbourhoods were fast disappearing and even well-to-do-Muslims were finding it a problem to buy property, Ahmedabad-based entrepreneur Mohammed Ali Husain began a property fair connecting Muslim builders with buyers.\nMore than 40,000 potential buyers have turned up for the two fairs he\&#39;s held so far, checking out and buying housing offered by 25 Muslim builders.\n&#34;Earlier communities lived in segregated neighbourhoods for cultural reasons,&#34; say Mr Husain. &#34;Now the reason is the fear of the other.&#34;\nDeep divisions\nIn a deeply divided and hierarchical society like India, segregated living - and housing - has existed for centuries.\nMumbai has community-based &#34;vegetarian only&#34; housing societies. Delhi and Calcutta have Muslim ghettos, crowded, run-down and neglected. A planned apartment coming up in Delhi promises &#34;dream homes for elite Muslim brotherhood&#34;.\nAhmedabad has been always divided on caste, community and religious lines. But, as analysts say, the ghettoisation was relative in the sense that Muslim-dominated areas co-existed with Hindu-dominated ones.\n&#34;These mixed neighbourhoods disappeared after Muslims became the main victims in communal riots which have gone on a par with their growing socio-economic marginalisation,&#34; write Christophe Jaffrelot and Charlotte Thomas in their study of ghettoisation in Ahmedabad.\nThe divisions of the past appeared to be more cultural in nature; the divisions of today appear to be rooted in fear, distrust and anomie.\nMr Kadri says he was picking up an order at a burger chain drive-thru a few years ago when he overheard the manager asking one of his delivery boys to not to deliver to Juhapura because, &#34;people will chop you into pieces if you go there&#34;.\nRising urbanisation was expected to blur religious and social boundaries, but that hasn\&#39;t happened fully.\nSo despite the fact that more than a third of India\&#39;s Muslims live in cities and towns - making them the most urbanised community of a significant size - poverty and discrimination continues to easily push them into ghettos.\nEven Dalits - formerly known as untouchables - who escape the stifling caste-based discrimination of their villages to live and work in the cities find that they still end up living in ghettos.\nKamlesh Revabhai Chauhan builds homes for the Dalits\nPoorer Dalits live in cheap homes made by Mr Chauhan...\n...while better-off ones like Naresh Parmar live in houses with air-conditioning and running water\nKamlesh Revabhai Chauhan is a Dalit builder in Ahmedabad who helps his community members find cheap homes.\nHe says he has built some 150 tenements and apartments in the last two decades, costing anything between 300,000 and 2 million rupees.\nThese days, he is building 90 more properties - tiny, self-contained apartments - in Sarkhej on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.\n&#34;Dalits are not given housing or shelter by other communities, so they buy homes from me in Dalit areas. They sell their land in the villages and buy homes here,&#34; he says.\nHis homes have been bought by policemen, clerks, factory workers,  and traders.\nUnkempt tenements\nAzadnagar Fathewadi is one such Dalit ghetto.\nThe better-off residents live in bigger, brightly painted homes, while the poorer ones live in poky, unkempt tenements on a different street.\nNaresh Parmar, who lives in a two-bedroom 140 sq yard house with air-conditioning and running water, rents out his two road rollers for a living.\nTen years ago, he bought this house from Mr Chauhan for five million rupees. There is a swing and a rope-bed on the verandah.\n&#34;This is like my village. I like the environment. When it becomes crowded like the city, I will pack up and go back to the village,&#34; he says.\nThere is almost what many say is a consensual silence on segregated living.\nLast month, Mumbai\&#39;s municipality passed a resolution saying it should stall a residential project if the builder plans to sell it on &#34;grounds of caste, religion or food preferences&#34;. It is not clear whether this can be enforced.\nIn the end, segregated housing - now increasingly driven by religious discrimination - is a blight on India\&#39;s progress.\n&#34;This marks the end of intimacy and formal integration of communities that every modern, civilised society needs,&#34; says political psychologist Ashis Nandy.\nMr Kadri, 45, offers his example to show how such segregation is harming India. &#34;I am what I am because I grew up in a cosmopolitan environment in mixed neighbourhoods,&#34; he says.\n&#34;Unfortunately my 12-year-son does not have the same privilege as he\&#39;s growing up in a ghetto. This is a big tragedy.

and four as &#34;suspected suicide&#34;.\nMany of the doctors suffered from a recognised mental disorder, such as depression, bipolar disorder and personality disorder, or had addiction problems.\nOther factors in their deaths may have included marriage breakdown, financial hardship and the impact of the GMC investigation.\nThe report calls on the GMC to treat every doctor as &#34;innocent until proven guilty&#34;.\nIt also recommends appointing a senior medical officer from the GMC to oversee cases involving doctors with health problems.\n\&#39;Stressful experience\&#39;\nThe GMC said it has made significant improvements to its fitness-to-practise investigations process in recent years - but recognises that it could offer more support to doctors.\nNiall Dickson, chief executive of the General Medical Council, said: &#34;We know too that for any doctor, being investigated by the GMC is a stressful experience and very often follows other traumas in their lives.\n&#34;Our first duty must, of course, be to protect patients but we are determined to do everything we can to make sure we handle these cases as sensitively as possible, to ensure the doctors are being supported locally and to reduce the impact of our procedures.&#34;\nHe said the aim was to handle complaints as quickly and effectively as possible.\nThe GMC will now review it procedures for dealing with doctors with health problems.\nDr Clare Gerada, medical director of the Practitioner Health Programme, a support service for doctors in London, said she welcomed the review.\n&#34;They [the GMC] need to continue to show their commitment to reducing the impact of fitness-to-practise investigations on vulnerable doctors whilst always maintaining patient safety - a substantial task.\n&#34;Doctors are sometimes patients too and supporting vulnerable doctors is a shared responsibility.&#34;\nDr Gerada said the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Practitioner Health Programme should all be involved in implementing the GMC\&#39;s recommendations.\nDr Michael Devlin, the head of professional standards and liaison, at the MDU said: &#34;We welcome the acknowledgment that delays in GMC investigations increase the stress on doctors and also that there should be a presumption of innocence until allegations about a doctor\&#39;s conduct, performance or health have been fully and properly investigated.\n&#34;Doctors facing GMC investigation need the help of their medical defence organisation and the MDU\&#39;s medico-legal advisers and lawyers are usually the first port of call for professional and personal support.&#34;\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Brain\&#39;s \&#39;internal compass\&#39; found\nThe precise part of the brain that gives people a sense of direction has been pinpointed by scientists.\nPeople with stronger nerve signals in their &#34;internal compass&#34; tended to be better navigators.\nThe study, published in the journal Current Biology, suggested people get lost when their compass cannot keep up.\nThe researchers in London hope the discovery will help explain why direction sense can deteriorate in conditions such as Alzheimer\&#39;s disease.\nScientists have long believed that such as signal existed within the brain, but until now it had been pure speculation.\nResearchers at University College London (UCL) asked 16 volunteers to familiarise themselves with a simple virtual courtyard.\nVolunteers were asked to navigate towards certain objects placed in four corners of the virtual room\nThey were then asked to navigate the area, from memory alone, while their brains were being scanned by an MRI machine.\nThe scans revealed a part of the brain - known as the entorhinal region - fired up consistently during the tasks.\nThe stronger the signal in the region, the better the volunteers were at finding their way around correctly.\nDr Hugo Spiers, who led the study, said: &#34;Studies on London cab drivers have shown that the first thing they do when they work out a route is calculate which direction they need to head in.\n&#34;We now know the entorhinal cortex is responsible for such calculations and the quality of the signals from this region seem to determine how good someone\&#39;s navigational skills will be.&#34;\nDr Martin Chadwick, who was also involved in the study, explained: &#34;Our results provide evidence to support the idea that your internal compass readjusts as you move through the environment.\n&#34;For example if you turn left, then your entorhinal region should process this to shift your facing direction and goal direction accordingly.\n&#34;If you get lost after taking too many turns, this may be because your brain could not keep up and failed to adjust.&#34;\nDegenerative diseases\nPrevious work by UCL researchers uncovered the role the entorhinal region plays in helping people understand what direction they are facing.\nThis new work suggests the area also helps them decide which direction to move in when heading to a new location.\nDr John Isaac, from the Wellcome Trust, which funded the study, said: &#34;Why some people are better navigators than others is intrinsically interesting, but it also helps us explain the processes that go wrong in degenerative diseases such as dementia - leaving people feeling lost and confused.&#34;\nMore on This Story\n27 APRIL 2012, SCIENCE &amp;

side effects would likely prevent their routine use in everyone.\n&#34;Noting that most [squamous cell carcinomas] are curable by surgery if caught early, this reduction in risk is interesting, but it is hard to say whether it is worth taking action over it.&#34;\nProf Brian Diffey, emeritus professor of photobiology, dermatological sciences at Newcastle University, said that reducing the risk of skin cancer by the same magnitude seen in the study could be done with a small reduction in sun exposure.\n&#34;Given that long-term therapy with NSAIDs is not without risk, a safer option for those who wish to reduce their likelihood of skin cancer may be to spend a few minutes a day less outside.&#34;\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Autism link to air pollution raised\nBy James Gallagher Health editor, BBC News website\nAir pollution link to 28,000 deaths\nA link between autism and air pollution exposure during pregnancy has been suggested by scientists.\nThe Harvard School of Public Health team said high levels of pollution had been linked to a doubling of autism in their study of 1,767 children.\nThey said tiny particulate matter, which can pass from the lungs to the bloodstream, may be to blame.\nExperts said pregnant women should minimise their exposure, although the link had still to be proven.\nAir pollution is definitely damaging. The World Health Organization estimates it causes 3.7 million deaths each year .\nThe study, published in Environmental Health Perspectives , investigated any possible link with autism.\nPollutants\nIt analysed 245 children with autism and 1,522 without.\nBy looking at estimated pollution exposure during pregnancy, based on the mother\&#39;s home address, the scientists concluded high levels of pollution were more common in children with autism.\nThe strongest link was with fine particulate matter - invisible specks of mineral dust, carbon and other chemicals - that enter the bloodstream and cause damage throughout the body.\nNitrogen dioxide is a by-product of diesel engines\nYet, the research is unable to conclusively say that pollution causes autism as there could be other factors that were not accounted for in the study.\nConsistent pattern\nThere is a large inherited component to autism, but lead researcher Dr Marc Weisskopf said there was mounting evidence that air pollution may play a role too.\nHe said: &#34;The specificity of our findings for the pregnancy period, and third trimester in particular, rules out many other possible explanations for these findings.\n&#34;The evidence base for a role for maternal exposure to air pollution increasing the risk of autism spectrum disorders is becoming quite strong.\n&#34;This not only gives us important insight as we continue to pursue the origins of autism spectrum disorders, but as a modifiable exposure, opens the door to thinking about possible preventative measures.&#34;\nProf Frank Kelly, the director of the environmental research group at King\&#39;s College London, told the BBC: &#34;I think if it was this study by itself I wouldn\&#39;t take much notice, but it\&#39;s now the fifth that has come to the same conclusion.\n&#34;It is biologically plausible, the placenta is there to ensure the foetus has optimal supply of nutrients, but if chemicals are entering the mother\&#39;s body then the foetus will have access to those too.\n&#34;Women should be made aware of the potential links so they don\&#39;t get excessive exposure.&#34;\nMore on This Story\nDid Vladimir Putin gamble on high oil prices lasting for ever?\nMost Popular\n&#39;, u&#39;Obesity \&#39;could be a disability\&#39; - EU courts rule\nLevels of obesity are rising across Europe\nWhere are you on the global fat scale?\nObesity can constitute a disability in certain circumstances, the EU\&#39;s highest court has ruled.\nThe European Court of Justice was asked to consider the case of a male childminder in Denmark who says he was sacked for being too fat.\nThe court said that if obesity could hinder &#34;full and effective participation&#34; at work then it could count as a disability.\nThe ruling is binding across the EU.\nContinue reading the main story\n\x93Start Quote\nIf employers suddenly have to start ensuring that they\&#39;ve got wider seats, larger tables, more parking spaces for people who are obese, I think then we\&#39;re just making the situation worse\x94\nEnd Quote Jane Deville Almond British Obesity Society\nJudges said that obesity in itself was not a disability - but if a person had a long-term impairment because of their obesity, then they would be protected by disability legislation.\nThe case centres around childminder Karsten Kaltoft who weighs about 160kg (25 stone).\nHe brought a discrimination case against his employers of 15 years, Billund local authority, after he was sacked four years ago.\nThe authority said a fall in the number of children meant Mr Kaltoft was no longer required.\nBut Mr Kaltoft said he was dismissed because he was overweight.\n\&#39;No problems\&#39;\nEarlier this year, he told the BBC that reports that he was so fat he was unable to bend down to tie children\&#39;s shoelaces were untrue.\nDescribing his work with children, he said: &#34;I can sit on the floor and play with them, I have no problems like that.\n&#34;I don\&#39;t see myself as disabled. It\&#39;s not OK just to fire a person because they\&#39;re fat, if they\&#39;re doing their job properly.&#34;\nThe Danish courts asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to clarify whether obesity was a disability.\nThe ECJ ruled that if the obesity of the worker &#34;hinders the full and effective participation of that person in professional life on an equal basis with other workers&#34;, then obesity can fall within the concept of &#34;disability&#34;.\nRulings from the European Court of Justice are binding for all EU member nations.\nThe courts in Denmark will now have to assess Mr Kaltoft\&#39;s weight to see if his case can be classed as a disability.\nAnalysis by Clive Coleman, BBC\&#39;s legal correspondent\nToday\&#39;s ruling was of great interest to employers across Europe. The judgement makes no direct link between Body Mass Index and obesity, but is a powerful statement that an obese worker whose weight hinders their performance at work is entitled to disability protection.\nThat will mean employers must, on a case by case basis, make reasonable adjustments such as providing larger chairs or special car parking, and protect such employees from verbal harassment.\nBut there are wider implications. Providers of goods and services such as shops, cinemas and restaurants will also have to make reasonable adjustments for their customers, which might include things like special seating arrangements.\nThe key concept here is that adjustments must be &#34;reasonable&#34; - so it may be deemed reasonable for a Premier League football club to make two seats available for someone disabled through obesity, but not for a small, non-league club.\nObesity, particularly what is sometimes known as morbid or severe and complex obesity, can be a particularly sensitive subject.\nEmployers and service providers will have to take care not to make assumptions about the needs of an obese worker or customer.\n\&#39;Wider seats\&#39;\nJane Deville Almond, the chairwoman of the British Obesity Society, said obesity should not be classed as a disability.\nShe told the BBC: &#34;I think the downside would be that if employers suddenly have to start ensuring that they\&#39;ve got wider seats, larger tables, more parking spaces for people who are obese, I think then we\&#39;re just making the situation worse.\nEmployers could be required to make their offices more accessible for obese employees\n&#34;[It is] implying that people have no control over the condition, rather than something that can be greatly improved by changing behaviour.&#34;\nPaul Callaghan, head of employment law at international law firm Taylor Wessing, said the ruling does not change UK law.\n&#34;The European Court of Justice has ruled that obesity itself is not a disability, but that the effects of it can be.\n&#34;As such, workers who suffer from, for example, joint problems, depression, or diabetes - specifically because of their size - will be protected by the European Equal Treatment Framework Directive and cannot be dismissed because of their weight.&#34;\nEmployers\&#39; responsibility\nAudrey Williams, employment law partner at Eversheds, said the mere fact someone is obese is not enough to make them disabled.\n&#34;What the court are saying is that obesity is not protected unless it hinders professional life.&#34;\nShe said the ruling would increase awareness among employers of their responsibility towards obese employees in the workplace.\nThis could include making reasonable adjustments to working arrangements, seating arrangements or making access to the office easier.\nHowever, Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the ruling had opened a can of worms for UK employers.\n&#34;They will be required to make adjustments to their furniture and doors and whatever is needed for very large people.\n&#34;I believe it will also cause friction in the workplace between obese people and other workers.&#34;\nOne in four people in the UK is classified as obese.\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Drug allergies: Culprit protein found\nPeople experience redness and swelling when taking certain medicines\nPeanut allergy treatment \&#39;a success\&#39;\nAllergic reactions to drugs and injections could stem from one single protein, research in mice suggests.\nThat protein may be responsible for itching, swelling and rashes suffered by people taking a wide range of medicines.\nSuch reactions stop people completing treatments and can sometimes be fatal.\nWriting in the journal Nature, scientists say they are exploring ways to block the protein and reduce these side-effects.\nRedness and rashes\nResearchers from the Johns Hopkins University, in Maryland, and the University of Alberta focused on reactions triggered by medicines prescribed for a number of conditions - from diabetes to HIV.\nThese reactions, also seen after some antibiotics or anti-cancer treatments, can spark a range of symptoms from redness to rashes.\nThey are different to the allergic reactions caused by food and those experienced by hay fever sufferers.\nScientists tested mice with and without a single protein - named MRGPRB2 - on their cells.\nMice without the protein did not suffer any redness, rashes or swelling despite being given drugs known to provoke reactions.\nAnd changes in blood pressure and heart rate - hallmarks of potentially dangerous reactions - were reduced.\nInjections - including vaccinations - can lead to allergic reactions\nDr Benjamin McNeil, at John Hopkins University School of Medicine, said: &#34;It\&#39;s fortunate that all of the drugs turn out to trigger a single receptor - it makes that receptor an attractive drug target.&#34;\nAnd if a new drug to block the protein receptor could be made, Dr McNeil said, this would help reduce the side-effects many patients currently endured.\nMaureen Jenkins, clinical director of Allergy UK, said: &#34;Allergic disease affects the immune system and the reactions are often very complex.\n&#34;All new methods to try and understand these reactions and to develop target treatments are welcomed.&#34;\nScientists are now investigating whether the same protein could be behind certain skin conditions -

There must be funds available so that there is an increase in the number of safe appropriate beds that local areas can access easily and quickly.\n&#34;If this does not happen then the change to the law will have a knock-on effect that will see children and young people transported hundreds of miles across the country or placed on adult wards which the Mental Health Act already states should not happen.&#34;\nCare and Support Minister Norman Lamb said: &#34;It\&#39;s essential that anyone experiencing a mental health crisis gets urgent, compassionate care in the right environment.\n&#34;I\&#39;ve been very clear that I want to ban the use of police cells for under 18s who need mental health care and I\&#39;m pleased that this is one of the main recommendations of the review.&#34;\nHe said the use of police cells for adults and children with mental health problems had reduced by 24% this year.\nEfi Hershkovitz, chief executive and founder of private care provider for young people Danshell, said: &#34;This is a step in the right direction but the government must ensure that \&#39;place of safety\&#39; beds are available for these vulnerable young people.

about staff coming under pressure from managers to manipulate cancer waiting times in order to meet government targets.\nThe trust conducted a &#34;retrospective review&#34; of 822 cancer patients\&#39; cases who were treated between 2010 and 2014 following the CQC\&#39;s report.\nIt found 16 cases of &#34;possible deliberate and inappropriate data entry&#34; but reviewers did not find a deliberate intent to falsify figures.\nCancer data \&#39;inaccuracies\&#39;\nEvidence of &#34;poor documentation and record keeping&#34;

This is Colchester\&#39;s chance to start again.\nA chance to change the culture and finally put people first.\nBut it stated: &#34;At no time were individuals instructed or bullied to amend cancer or any other data inappropriately by any senior manager.&#34;\nThere was criticism of the way former Finance Director Mike Baker, supported by former Workforce Director Rob Bowman, carried out an original investigation into the allegations in 2012.\nMr Baker resigned when the CQC revealed the allegations.\nHe told the BBC last December: &#34;I was planning to retire and when I read the report I decided to bring it forward and I resigned. I feel I let my people down.&#34;\nThe hospital trust apologised &#34;unreservedly&#34; to patients who suffered delays or poor care\nThose who conducted the inquiry were told a new &#34;validation process&#34; was introduced to the cancer service in 2011.\nWhen one of the team members began to notice changes to the data - which they believed were incorrect - they raised concerns with senior managers, including associate director of the cancer department, Mark Jarman-Howe, who believed the data was correct.\nAn investigation into the concerns began in February 2012, which has been described as &#34;flawed and mismanaged&#34;.\nThe report said Mr Jarman-Howe\&#39;s decisions about how to validate data were out of step with his colleagues\&#39; understanding of Cancer Waiting Time Guidance.\nMr Jarman-Howe left the trust in 2012.\nCancer services manager at Colchester Hospital, Rachael West, was suspended on full pay in November last year while the allegations were investigated.\nBoth Ms West and Mr Jarman-Howe, along with other senior manages, were cleared of any bullying and harassment and deliberately manipulating data.\nDr Moore told the BBC that Ms West\&#39;s future at the trust would be discussed in light of the report.\nThe hospital said it had made a number of improvements to its cancer services over the last year\nThe trust\&#39;s Chairman Peter Wilson said although no evidence was found of a &#34;systematic culture of bullying&#34;, the issue is taken &#34;very seriously&#34;\nAdam Cayley, regional director at Monitor, said: &#34;Today\&#39;s report should bring a very difficult chapter in the history of this trust to a close.\n&#34;It is reassuring to find that there is no evidence of staff being bullied into changing cancer data, but it is even clearer that there were serious managerial failures at the trust.&#34;\n&#34;The new management team at the hospital is already delivering improvements for patients - a process we expect to see continue,&#34;

in supporting councils in their new roles.\nIt said spending on public health &#34;varies widely&#34; between different areas, saying this was &#34;not surprising&#34; given local differences.\nSpending risk\nBut it went on to highlight that areas where alcohol abuse increased the most between 2010/11 and 2012/13 were spending &#34;significantly less&#34; on alcohol services in the following year than the areas where levels of abuse had fallen.\n&#34;Some local authority spending decisions are not yet fully aligned with areas of concern,&#34; it concluded.\nThe NAO also said records of how the cash has been allocated by some local authorities were inaccurate.\nFunding for public health went up by 5.5% in 2013/14 but the government has not decided how long the ring-fence will remain in place and the NAO warned that contingency plans must be put in place to deal with changes in funding.\n&#34;There is a risk that total public health spending will decline as local authorities face continued budget reductions,&#34; it said.\n\&#39;Unacceptable\&#39;\nThe report also highlighted the continued wide gaps in healthy life expectancy, which for men ranges from 52.5 years in Tower Hamlets to 70 years in Richmond upon Thames.\nLabour MP Margaret Hodge, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee, said this disparity was &#34;unacceptable&#34;.\nShe said: &#34;Good public health is critical to reducing the burden on local health economies and the wider NHS at a time when the health service is facing unprecedented financial challenges, as well as improving the lives of individuals.&#34;\nMore on This Story\nResidents of IS-run Mosul sick from drinking the river\nMost popular\n&#39;, u&#39;Print\nEbola: Sierra Leone begins house-to-house searches\nThe authorities want to ensure that anyone who may be displaying symptoms of Ebola comes forward for treatment\nSierra Leone has begun house-to-house searches in the capital Freetown to find hidden cases of Ebola.\nPresident Ernest Bai Koroma said that Sunday trading would be banned and travel between districts restricted.\nThe president said that as Christmas approached, people would need to be reminded that Sierra Leona was at war with a &#34;vicious enemy&#34;.\nSierra Leone has overtaken Liberia to have the highest number of Ebola cases, World Health Organization figures show.\nThe virus has killed more than 6,800 people this year, mostly in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.\nSierra Leone has had more Ebola cases than any other country\nIn his statement, President Koroma said the searches aimed to &#34;break the chain of transmission&#34;.\nHe added: &#34;Do not hide the sick.&#34;\nThe president said that while many districts of the country had made progress in fighting Ebola, challenges still remained in the western part of the country, which for the past two weeks had accounted for 50% of new infections.\nHe said that he was introducing an action plan, Operation Western Area Surge, to encourage people to come forward if they had a fever or other symptoms of Ebola.\nHe said it was necessary to introduce such stringent measures even though it was the festive season -  a time when people would normally &#34;celebrate with their families in a joyous manner&#34;.\nThe president also said that:\nTravel restrictions between districts would be enforced over the Christmas period\nChristians would be allowed to attend church services, but would be requested to return home immediately afterwards\nAll New Year\&#39;s Day festivities including church services and outings would be prohibited or severely restricted\nIn addition to the blanket Sunday trading ban, the new measures would include time restrictions on Saturday and weekday shopping.\nThe prevalence of the virus in the capital Freetown is thought to be one of the reasons why Ebola is spreading so fast in the west.\nOur correspondent in Sierra Leone, Umaru Fofana, said the measures were partly aimed at controlling crowds.\nHe said people in Freetown continued to gather on the streets or go jogging along the beach despite the Ebola threat.\nThis is not the first time that Sierra Leone has used stringent tactics to locate Ebola sufferers, but none have stopped the rise in infections.\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head Tom Frieden told the AP news agency that &#34;the fight is going to be long and hard to get to zero cases&#34;, and is heavily contingent on sick individuals coming forward to be diagnosed.\nEbola deaths\nDeaths - probable, confirmed and suspected\n(Includes one in the US and six in Mali)\n3,290 Liberia\nDid Vladimir Putin gamble on high oil prices lasting for ever?\nMost Popular\n&#39;, u&#39;Brazil Olympics: Super-bacteria found in Rio sea waters\nThe world-famous Christ the Redeemer statue can be seen from Flamengo beach\nResearchers in Brazil have discovered drug-resistant bacteria in the sea waters where sailing and windsurfing events will be held during the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe &#34;super-bacteria&#34; are usually found in hospital waste and produce an enzyme, KPC, resistant to antibiotics.\nResearchers found the bacteria in samples taken from Flamengo beach.\nNearly 70% of sewage in Rio - a city of some 10 million people - is spilled raw into the waters of Guanabara Bay.\nThe bacteria were found in samples taken from several locations along the Carioca river.\nOne sample was found at the point where the river flows into the bay on Flamengo beach.\nResidents have been told to take extra care. Flamengo beach is frequently declared unfit for swimming, but many people disregard the official warnings.\n\&#39;Not completely clean\&#39;\nThe superbug can cause urinary, gastrointestinal and pulmonary infections.\nSamples taken from the mouth of the Carioca river on Flamengo beach had traces of the bacteria\nHundreds of millions of gallons of untreated sewage flow daily into Guanabara Bay\nThe government has built artificial beaches with clean water for Rio\&#39;s poorer communities\n&#34;The problem is that in case of infection it is possible that treatment involves hospitalisation,&#34; said Ana Paula D\&#39;Alincourt Carvalho Assef, the study coordinator at Rio\&#39;s renowned Oswaldo Cruz Institute.\n&#34;Since the super-bacteria are resistant to the most modern medications, doctors need to rely on drugs that are rarely used because they are toxic to the organism,&#34; she told the AP news agency.\nIn its Olympic bid, Rio promised to reduce pollution in Guanabara Bay by 80%.\nBut in June Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes admitted the target would not be met.\n&#34;I am sorry that we did not use the games to get Guanabara Bay completely clean,&#34; said Mr Paes.\nThe authorities say they understand athletes\&#39; concerns but insist that water pollution will not pose a major health risk during the Olympics, which will be held in August 2016.\nMore on This Story\n07 JANUARY 2014, LATIN AMERICA &amp; CARIBBEAN\nFrom other news sites\nDid Vladimir Putin gamble on high oil prices lasting for ever?\nMost Popular\n&#39;, u&#39;Smooth Operator?

Cardiff surgeons have been looking at which songs work best for operations.\nAfter a study of music and healing, Cardiff\&#39;s University Hospital of Wales came up with a tongue-in-cheek list of what to play in theatre.\nWhile classical music is preferred by most surgeons, some more current suggestions were put forward.\nSade\&#39;s Smooth Operator was approved - but REM\&#39;s Everybody Hurts is a no-no.\nSome of the comical suggestions for songs to be played during surgery\nAlthough the songs are only meant as a bit of festive fun from medical staff at the hospital, the benefits of music helping patients and surgeons alike stems from a legitimate study .\nAccording to their findings, around 80% of theatre staff said music helped while carrying out operations.\nThey also found that music is played 62-72% of the time in the operating theatre, with songs often chosen by the lead surgeon.\n\&#39;Like a surgeon\&#39;\nPublished in the Christmas issue of the British Medical Journal , theatre staff said music improved communication between staff, reduced anxiety and improved efficiency.\nThey also reported surgical performances were enhanced when music was played by increasing task focus - particularly among surgeons who listen to music regularly.\nAccording to the report\&#39;s authors, critics argue that music &#34;consumes cognitive bandwidth, reduces vigilance, impairs communication, and proves a distraction when anaesthetic problems are encountered&#34;.\nBut they said they &#34;embrace music in the operating theatre whenever the situation allows it&#34;.\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Huddles \&#39;help children\&#39;s hospital care\&#39;\nBy Dr Peter Lachman Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health\nHuddles can help\nExercise guidelines \&#39;hard to meet\&#39;\nIt\&#39;s good to talk, we\&#39;re always told. And now child health expert Dr Peter Lachman says &#34;huddles&#34; - informal meetings of hospital staff - are a simple way of improving children\&#39;s hospital care.\nA lot can be said for good communication - it\&#39;s a simple art which if done properly can build and maintain strong relationships, improve efficiency and most of all, improve outcomes.\nDone badly, it can cause uncertainty and confusion.\nIn healthcare, good communication is essential if we are to ensure best practice and offer patients, regardless of postcode, access to safe, high quality care at the earliest opportunity.\nSilos\nCurrently, coordination of care across the specialties is difficult and this can contribute to extended hospital stays and repeat admissions.\nThis places increased pressure on the NHS which simply isn\&#39;t sustainable.\nI\&#39;m not saying there is uncertainty in the health system, but there is still much more that can be done to improve care.\nIn paediatrics, there are many professionals working in silos which is preventing nurses, paediatricians and patients and parents themselves, working together effectively.\nAlthough it sounds simple, it\&#39;s actually complex to execute\x94\nEnd Quote\nAs a consultant paediatrician, I know the value of working as part of a multi-professional team, drawing on the expertise of a range of colleagues and working in partnership with the child and family members to care for that child.\nThere must be a shift in attitude - from reaction to anticipation, otherwise we\&#39;ll never dispel extended hospital stays and repeat admissions.\nAn intervention called the \&#39;huddle\&#39; is one way of shifting this attitude.\nIt\&#39;s a model pioneered in Cincinnati Children\&#39;s Hospital around 12 months ago and one that has been adopted by a number of units in Scotland - to much praise by the Scottish Health Secretary, Alex Neil.\nSo what actually is it and why isn\&#39;t it being used elsewhere in the UK?\nSickest children seen sooner\nThousands of sick children could be helped by \&#39;simple changes\&#39;\nThe huddle and situation awareness are new concepts in healthcare and although it sounds simple, it\&#39;s actually complex to execute - it\&#39;s a change from the way people think and a change in culture.\nThe huddle is a short exchange of information between all involved in a patient\&#39;s care.\nIt\&#39;s a meeting which can be called by anyone, at any time to enhance \&#39;situation awareness,\&#39; by offering a platform to openly discuss patient care with colleagues, determine which patients\&#39; need to be prioritised and what the best treatment is for them.\nFor example, at the start of my shift there might be 12 patients.\nContinue reading the main story\n\x93Start Quote\nThe project aims to reduce avoidable error and harm of up to 4,000 acutely sick children by 2016 and involve parents and patients more in their care\x94\nEnd Quote\nThe nurse and I call a \&#39;huddle\&#39; -  three children have just returned to the ward following surgery and another child can actually be discharged.\nHowever two other children need urgent attention. As a result, I see the urgent patients before seeing the other 10 children.\nNot only does this mean the sickest children are identified earlier and subsequently get treated quicker, it also means they can get better and can leave hospital much sooner.\nIt also has huge benefits to the workforce as it allows skills to be enhanced through the sharing of best practice, performance to be sustained and consistent treatment delivered in hospitals regardless of postcode.\nBetter care hope\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, on behalf of the Situation Awareness for Everyone (S.A.F.E) partnership, received a cash injection from the Health Foundation of \u0141450,000 to trial a number of quality improving techniques - including the huddle - at 12 hospital sites up and down the country.\nThrough the development of these techniques and enhanced communication between families, patients and professionals, the project aims to reduce avoidable error and harm of up to 4,000 acutely sick children by 2016 and involve parents and patients more in their care.\nWe estimate that this programme could reduce deterioration of children in paediatric wards by at least 50% and decrease serious outcomes by at least 10%.\nWe also believe that there will be a reduction in serious incidents and a culture shift from reactive responses to proactive prevention of harm.\nIf proven successful, there is scope for this model to be rolled out wider so it not only improves the care of children, but improves the care delivered to adults in the UK and beyond.\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Why 361 needles are better than one\nBy Roland Pease BBC Radio Science Unit\nMany adults, as well as children, dislike needles\nIs bushmeat behind Ebola outbreak?\nOne in 10 of us are said to have a fear of the hypodermic needle, a necessary but frequently uncomfortable fact of medical life.\nWhile the needle is an efficient way to administer drugs and take samples for analysis, it still involves sticking a sharp bit of metal into the body.\nThis is problematic for many children, but particularly premature babies.\nSince they are typically ill, premature babies are given a lot of medicines. But, because of their vulnerability, doctors need to take frequent blood samples as to ensure they get the right dose.\nThis could come in the form of regular injections, or the insertion of a permanent cannula, a procedure which is difficult enough to administer in grown adults.\n\&#39;Like a cat\&#39;s tongue\&#39;\nMany researchers have tried to find an alternative solution.\nNow, Prof Ryan Donnelly from Queens University Belfast and his team think they have come up with a solution. Not one needle, but 361.\nThe device looks like a small, clear plastic patch about half a centimetre across, which easily sits on the tip of your finger. One side looks quite rough.\nMicroneedle patch compared to traditional needle\n&#34;It\&#39;s a patch with 361 tiny, individual needles on it,&#34; explains Prof Donnelly.\nThe patch feels slightly rough to the touch, something akin to Velcro or a cats tongue. But the individual needles are extremely hard, and sharp at the tips.\nUnlike normal hypodermic needles, these microneedles only penetrate the top layer of your skin. They don\&#39;t contact the nerves, which is why you feel no pain. Nor do they go into your blood vessels.\nInstead they collect the so called interstitial fluid which surrounds the cells in the outer layer of skin.\nThis fluid contains all the information the doctor requires.\n\&#39;Very distressed\&#39;\nIt\&#39;s always worse for the parents - you don\&#39;t want to see your child getting stabbed\x94\nEnd Quote Sofie Backstrom Mother of a premature baby\n&#34;Quite often they\&#39;ll need to have their blood monitored four times a day. If we can use these microneedles instead, we don\&#39;t have to take any blood at all.&#34;\nDr Brady adds: &#34;There are real problems associated with hypodermic needles, such as scarring and bruising.\n&#34;Using microneedles instantly eliminates any issues with scaring, bruising and damage to tissue.&#34;\nParents are very much in favour of something that could be applied as easily as a sticking plaster because, as Prof Ryan says, they become &#34;very distressed&#34; by the invasive medical procedures their children have to be subjected to.\nSofie Backstrom\&#39;s daughter Freja has just turned one, but she was born three months prematurely at 26 weeks.\n&#34;When she was born she had blood samples taken almost daily for the first three months,&#34; says Sofie.\nShe still has injection scars from that time.\n&#34;They\&#39;re mainly on the back of her hands and feet but on her knees and elbows too - about 20 scars on each.&#34;\nSofie would have welcomed a pain-free alternative.\n&#34;I think it\&#39;s always worse for the parents - you don\&#39;t want to see your child getting stabbed.&#34;\nDrug delivery\nPlastic patch promises pain free injections\nProf Donnelly and his team aren\&#39;t the only ones developing an alternative to injections. Several groups around the world are working on similar technologies, including Linda Klavinskis, an immunobiologist from Kings College London.\nMicroneedles can also be used for drug delivery and she is very excited about their potential. &#34;One of the most profound effects will be the ability to deliver vaccines at a reduced cost.\n&#34;Microneedles are very simple, you don\&#39;t need specially trained staff and they won\&#39;t need any of the paraphernalia of a conventional vaccine.&#34;\nCompounds can be incorporated into the polymer patches when they are made, and are slowly released into the body once they come into contact with the interstitial fluid.\nKeeping cool\nProf Donnelly\&#39;s team have used the patches to administer everything from insulin to ibuprofen.\nMicroneedles could also do away with the need to refrigerate vaccines.\nMost vaccines need to be kept cold to stay effective and to prevent bacterial growth.\nTrapped inside the polymer patches the vaccines should be stable in a dry state, even at warm temperatures.\nIt makes the needles particularly useful for vaccination campaigns in remote areas, where delivering and storing conventional liquid vaccines can be a challenge.\nProf Donnelly  says: &#34;Up to 50% of vaccines do not work in the developing world, because they\&#39;ve inadvertently been allowed to warm beyond 38C, or they\&#39;ve been frozen by mistake, which can damage the vaccine.&#34;.\nIf a patient receives a vaccine that hasn\&#39;t been refrigerated properly it may not work and could lead to septicaemia and even death.\nNeedle stick injuries\n&#39;, u&#39;Media playback is unsupported on your device\nTory MP on acupuncture, herbal medicine and homeopathy\n18 December 2014 Last updated at 12:17 GMT\nTraditional medicines could be used instead of drugs to save the health service money, says a Conservative MP who sits on the influential House of Commons Health Select Committee,\nIn a personal film, David Tredinnick puts the case for alternatives, and reckoned those who criticise homeopathy are &#34;ignorant bullies&#34; who have never studied it.\n&#39;, u&#39;Media playback is unsupported on your device\nDenmark patients visiting the doctor via the internet\n18 December 2014 Last updated at 06:24 GMT\nThe internet is set to make dramatic changes to the relationship between doctor and patient.\nUsing the latest communications technology, doctors can now diagnose and treat patients many miles from their consulting rooms.\nMalcolm Brabant looks at the work of one state-of-the-art clinic in Denmark.\nBBC \u0160 2014 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

But when should we worry, asks Joan Bakewell.\nGetting old just happens of course.  It creeps up on you when you aren\&#39;t looking and suddenly you\&#39;re forgetting names and losing keys.  At once alarm bells ring -  could this be the first indication of dementia?\nI am in my 80s now and I would be foolish not to consider whether these irritating incidents are more than simple forgetfulness.  I console myself - wasn\&#39;t I always forgetful, without taking it as a sign of something significant?\nWhen I mentioned the problem to my novelist friend Malcolm Bradbury, he sympathised. &#34;But Joan, you and I have stuffed our brains full throughout our lives, we shouldn\&#39;t be surprised if some of it begins to fall off the shelf.&#34; I felt better, and carried on being randomly forgetful.\nFind out more\nSuppose I Lose It will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 16 December at 20:00 GMT\nCatch up afterwards on iPlayer\nBut now the argument has quickened.  Dementia is growing in its impact as we all live longer lives. It\&#39;s reckoned there are more than 800,000 sufferers in the UK. When and how will I know if I am one of them?\nIt\&#39;s estimated 61% of people worry that they may be afflicted in the future - that number rises to 66% for the over 55s.  At least I am not alone.  Indeed I am among friends.\nI have known the actors Timothy West and his wife Prunella Scales for four decades. If we aren\&#39;t exactly in and out of each other\&#39;s houses, we certainly go to each other\&#39;s parties, exchange Christmas cards and rejoice in the successes of children and, more recently, grandchildren.\nOver the past year they together have decided to go public on the fact that Pru has dementia.\nIt first began with lines. Pru has had a distinguished career for over 50 years. She has starred in some of television\&#39;s most popular series: Marriage Lines, opposite Richard Briers, After Henry, Mapp and Lucia, and of course, as Sybil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers.   About 15 years ago she began to notice it was getting harder to remember lines.  She put it down to age.\nHer last stage appearance was five years ago in Carrie\&#39;s War in the West End.  Of course, work continues with voiceovers which she can still handle with her usual flair and aplomb. But their doctor indicated that her condition would get worse.  It is getting worse, but only slowly.\nI enter their home exactly as I know it, full of welcome and laughter, cups of tea and theatre gossip. But there are differences - a huge whiteboard in the kitchen lists in order the things Pru will be doing that day.  A trained helper, Meegan, familiar with the progression of dementia, has moved in to live with them.  She goes about her caring with a tactful absence of fuss.\nWe sit and talk about the how much their lives are affected and it becomes clear there are two narratives here. Pru complains of occasionally forgetting things - &#34;but then I am 82 years old - surely that\&#39;s allowed&#34;.\nBut she is shocked when Tim explains how at a party Pru will tell someone the same anecdote time after time. &#34;Oh, I don\&#39;t do that do I? Surely not. Oh how dreadful.&#34; I hear in her outrage the familiar response of the Pru I know. But her response is characteristic of the denial which is common among dementia sufferers.\nWhat is dementia?\nComputer graphic of an Alzheimer patient\&#39;s brain (left) compared with a normal brain (right)\nAn umbrella term referring to a collection of symptoms, which may include memory loss and difficulties with problem-solving or language\nProgressive condition caused by brain disease, currently without cure\nAlzheimer\&#39;s disease affects 62% of those living with dementia\nAbout 800,000 people formally diagnosed with dementia in UK - but only 43% with the condition get a diagnosis\nApproximately one in 20 people over age 65 have it, rising to one in six by the age of 80. One in three in the UK will have it by the time they die\nSource: Alzheimer\&#39;s society , BBC Science\nThe fact is dementia is changing her and their lives together, but as in the best of marriages it is a shift rather than a catastrophe. Tim clearly feels the loss - when they go out for the evening together they both enjoy the event,  but once back home Pru can\&#39;t talk about it because it has already slipped from her memory.\nI leave for home reflecting on how several friends of my generation are now drifting into this unknown world. I wonder about my own forgetfulness and decide it is, so far as I can tell, of a quite different order.  Nonetheless it is evident enough for me to take small avoiding steps -  sticky notes left around the house,  a notepad beside the bed, a list of things to do each day.\nBut then didn\&#39;t I do that already when the overload of my busy life threatened to engulf me? I have been a journalist for over 40 years, working in different media and keeping tabs on what I do through well-ordered and sometime scruffy diaries, shelves of files and dependence on the support of agents and editors.   The agents and editors might well say their support has got stronger in recent months.  I happily take for granted their loyalty and friendship.  A network of obligations that keeps me busy and committed is keeping me on track. If dementia looms, I simply haven\&#39;t time to notice.\nNonetheless what I\&#39;ve been learning about early intervention, the memory clinics, the ongoing research, is enough to persuade me that staying alert for symptoms and confronting fears early is the best way to grow old. I know I shall be taking those memory tests one day soon.\nThe UK is only now gearing up to meet the enormous challenge dementia presents for the future. There will always be a struggle for resources and new skills. If individuals can help with their own diagnoses, rather than hide away from bad news, then that will help.\nThere\&#39;s no denying the harrowing experience of families whose members no longer know who they are. But my friends Tim and Pru have shown me that there can still sometimes be happiness and laughter to be got out of life.\nThe Magazine on dementia\n&#39;, u&#39;Why are hospitals under so much pressure?\nJoined-up care: The elephant in the room\nYou need look no further than Salford Royal Hospital to realise the point the NHS has got to.\nThe trust is generally regarded as one of the best - if not the best - in the UK.

This is not a quirk. It\&#39;s been dragged down along with the rest of the hospital sector.\nOnce you strip out the small units and walk-in centres, where the pressure is less intense, seven out of eight of England\&#39;s 141 major units are now missing the target.\nIf this sort of performance continues for the rest of the month, the quarterly results for October to December will be the worst since the target was introduced in 2004.\nPerformance levels in Wales and Northern Ireland are even lower (Scotland seems to be performing at a similar level to England, although as the data there lags behind the other parts of the UK, it is hard to say for sure).\nThis is despite ministers in all four corners of the UK handing the health service extra money to deal with winter pressures.\nHow performance compares in UK\nNation\nUsing #nhswinter on Twitter\nBut what is interesting as you delve down into the data is that it\&#39;s not just A&amp;E; units that are finding it difficult - there are pressure points across the whole system.\nNearly a fifth of patients who go to A&amp;E; need to be admitted into the hospital for more complex care than can be given in an emergency department. Sometimes they face long waits (classed as over four hours) before a bed can be found for them. These are known as &#34;trolley waits&#34;.\nThe latest weekly figures show they topped 7,000. That is the highest since weekly collections began in 2010.\nBut hospitals are also finding it difficult to discharge patients. The figures for September , the last full month for which they are available, were at their highest since that data set began in 2010.\nA significant factor in this is the squeeze on councils\&#39; social care budgets. Many of the patients who end up in hospital are frail and elderly, and when they are ready to be released need support in the community to get back on their feet. If it\&#39;s not there, they have to stay in hospital, which occupies a bed often needed for other patients.\nAnother pressure point is at the other end of the system - before the visit to hospital is made. Both the Royal College of GPs and British Medical Association have been vocal about the workload their members are facing.\nA recent BMA survey found three quarters of doctors said their caseload was &#34;unsustainable&#34; - and that seems to have started impacting on patients, as latest data from the official NHS England patient survey shows they are finding it more difficult to get an appointment.\nIf GPs are unable to keep pace with demand, the obvious place patients turn to is A&amp;E.;\nTo be fair to ministers across the UK, they have recognised this. Wales, Scotland and England have all published plans in the last 18 months to relieve the pressure on the urgent and emergency care systems.\nBut these are all long-term solutions. In the short-term, all eyes are on what happens this winter.\nSo what next? &#34;Predictions are very hard to make,&#34; says Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals. &#34;What we don\&#39;t know is what will happen with Norovirus or flu. Services are so stretched at the moment, that all it will take is a spike in those to make it very difficult for us.&#34;\nIt seems to be the case that despite all the planning, all the money, and all the hard work of NHS staff, this winter will hinge on factors outside everyone\&#39;s control.\n&#39;, u&#34;Media playback is unsupported on your device\nA night on Norwich&#39;s SOS bus\n19 December 2014 Last updated at 00:00 GMT\nTowns and cities across the UK are in peak Christmas party season.\nFriday 19 December has been dubbed Mad Friday as it marks the start of one of the busiest weekends of the year for ambulance services and hospitals as thousands of revellers hit bars and clubs.\nIn Norwich, the SOS Bus is a year-round service that helps people suffering the effects of too much alcohol or otherwise in distress during a night out.\nRun by volunteers, and with the support of an NHS Paramedic, the service helps take the pressure off the ambulance service and A&amp;E; by providing a safe place.\nAs they geared up for one of the busiest times of the year, BBC News spent a night on board.\nVideo Journalist: John Galliver\n&#34;, u&#39;The hidden lives of those who care\nBy Laurence Cawley BBC News\nSchoolgirls Leah Doak (left) and Claire Stevenson (right) are both carers for their mothers. They are pictured above during a support session at West Norfolk Carers\nWhile nobody sets out to be an unpaid carer, it is a job more than six million people currently perform, according to the 2011 Census. This hidden workforce, thought to save the economy \u0141119bn a year, is drawn from all ages and backgrounds.\nHere are a few of their stories.\nGill\nContinue reading the main story\n&#34;You\&#39;ll be listening to the radio on a Friday and somebody will say \&#39;hey, it\&#39;s nearly the weekend\&#39; or \&#39;the weekend\&#39;s nearly here\&#39;,&#34; says Gill West, who is a full time carer for her father George. &#34;And? That makes absolutely no difference to carers. Carers don\&#39;t have weekends.&#34;\nGeorge, 86, has Alzheimer\&#39;s Disease and vascular dementia. He and Gill live in Harrow, north-west London.\nIn the three-and-a-half years that Gill - previously a human resources project consultant - has cared for her father, she has had just 10 days off.\n&#34;I now have a very different life,&#34; she says. &#34;It is tough and it is difficult.\n&#34;When you meet up with your \&#39;normal\&#39; friends you realise they are all living \&#39;normally\&#39; - they might be talking about a promotion or a holiday or a new purchase. My whole world is caring.\n&#34;When you meet with other carers you can have a laugh about the things that happen in our daily lives.&#34;\nAs well as setting up a number of coffee mornings for carers, Gill, using her HR skills, has also developed her own courses to help new carers.\n&#34;I felt lost and isolated when I started out on my caring journey and wanted to help others, something positive to make my journey more worthwhile.&#34;\nRachel and Anjeli\nTrevor, Rachel and Anjeli Diack\nRachel and Anjeli Diack\&#39;s mother has multiple sclerosis.\n&#34;Our dad (Trevor) does most of the caring&#34;, says Anjeli, 12, of King\&#39;s Lynn, Norfolk. &#34;But he works full time and we are needed to help out.\n&#34;In the last six months we have done more and more caring for mum and also lots more cleaning up and tidying up in the house because mum can\&#39;t do things like that anymore.\n&#34;We help with her medication too, which is sometimes difficult to get right with all the different tablets she needs to take every day.&#34;\nShivakuru and Meenadchyammah\n(L to R) Shivakuru,  Meenadchyammah and Anutha Selvathurai live in a small small ground floor flat in Harrow\nShivakuru Selvathurai removes his spectacles to wipe the tears from his eyes. A Tamil refugee, he has been describing the horrors of the Sri Lankan civil war he witnessed first hand.\nHe, his wife Meenadchyammah and their daughter Anutha fled in 2001. They lived first in Liverpool and then in Harrow.\nShivakuru, 70, knows better than most the polarities of violence and kindness of which human beings are capable. Anutha, 37, has profound learning difficulties and needs round-the-clock care.\nYet Anutha\&#39;s considerable needs are dwarfed by Shivakuru and Meenadchyammah\&#39;s need to give. Not just to their daughter, but to the wider community.\n&#34;We have needed so much help,&#34; he says, &#34;with our housing problems, language difficulties with the authorities, getting the right support from health service providers and money advice for our daughter who has some intensive and pressing needs.\n&#34;We are so very grateful to the UK Government and the British people generally.&#34;\nShivakuru has been a residents group champion, he volunteers for the NHS, the Royal British Legion, the Army Benevolent Fund and other charities. He is a multiple recipient of the Harrow Heroes Volunteer Award.\nWhy does he do it? The answer, he says, is that when he and his family were in desperate need, the UK provided them with sanctuary. His role now, he says, is to give something back.\nRonnie and Roger\nRonnie and Roger Lewis sat at Ronnie\&#39;s craft table\nRonnie Lewis struggles to speak. &#34;Some days I can\&#39;t stop crying,&#34; she says.\nBefore her first severe stroke a decade ago, Ronnie, who lives beside a busy carriageway in west Norfolk, was an avid artist.\nShe still has her bright and airy studio, the walls lined with box upon box of arts and crafts material. But now even the simplest of tasks - such as gluing small feathers to a piece of paper - takes enormous effort.\n&#34;And some days I\&#39;m so tired I cannot get out of bed.&#34;\nTwo further strokes followed that first one 10 years ago. Her husband, Roger, a former publican, is her carer.\n&#34;There is not much time for anything besides being a carer,&#34; he says. &#34;I do like to potter around our garden and I still nurture the idea of doing some more wine-making again one day.&#34;\nMukesh\nMukesh Maroo is in the unusual situation of being both a carer for his elderly mother and needing a carer himself after undergoing  major knee surgery\n&#34;For me, being a carer is a blessing,&#34; says 49-year-old Mukesh Maroo.\nMukesh arrived in the UK from Kenya at the age of 10. While his late father ran a successful business in the UK, he believes the &#34;shock&#34; of emigrating - the &#34;longing for home&#34; and a sense of &#34;isolation&#34; - had a profound and lasting effect on his mother, for whom he is a primary carer.\nIn the aftermath of major knee surgery, Mukesh, himself a successful businessman, now finds himself both a carer and a recipient of care.\nMukesh, who lives in Harrow, says caring brings people back to fundamental needs - of loving, being loved, of giving and asking for the help of others.\n&#34;Too many people are almost \&#39;cocooned\&#39; from each other - what we all need to again do is switch on our ability to care, by lessening our suspicions of each other,&#34; he says.\nJackie\nJackie Haverson went for the first night out with her husband in four years. A mere 30 minutes had passed before the couple were called home.\nFor most of us, booking a holiday has become a simple series of steps, clicking boxes on a website and entering payment details.\nNot so for Jackie Haverson, who lives with her husband and two disabled daughters in King\&#39;s Lynn.\nOne daughter has epilepsy and dyspraxia, the other attention deficit disorder.\n&#34;When we book a hotel abroad we have to check what type of lights they use (because some can trigger an epileptic fit), where the nearest hospital is, how we might get to that hospital if we need it, how busy it is, what disabled facilities they have and so on,&#34; she says.\n&#34;We have to plan everything strategically and do it so far ahead. But we do it because we want our girls to enjoy their childhood.&#34;\nA few weeks ago, Jackie and her husband went out for their first drink together in about four years. After half an hour, the babysitter - who knows the daughters well - found she could not cope with their needs.\n&#34;We didn\&#39;t even finish our drinks.&#34;\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Victims of a craze for cosmetic surgery\nBy Stephen Evans BBC News, Seoul\nChristingle: The Christmas tradition that only got going in the 1960s\nYou can\&#39;t avoid the adverts. Everywhere you go in Seoul, you are urged to change your shape through plastic surgery. In affluent Gangnam, every wall seems to have a sign pointing to a surgery.\nOn the train and in the street, you\&#39;re told you can &#34;bring your face to life&#34;. &#34;Facial contouring&#34; is on offer - &#34;breast surgery&#34;, &#34;anti-ageing&#34;, &#34;eyeplasty&#34;, &#34;body contouring&#34;. There is &#34;square jaw reduction&#34; (mainly, the adverts imply, for men). Or transforming your face &#34;from saggy and loose to elastic and dimensional&#34;, targeted mostly at women.\nOne acquaintance of mine complains that her chin becomes painful when it rains. And then it emerges that she went into the surgery for a nose job but got persuaded - or persuaded herself - that it was her chin that really needed its contours changing. The result: a more shapely chin that is also a more painful chin. Despite that, she is now intent on breast enlargement.\nThis is not a human face - it is more revolting than monsters or aliens\x94\nEnd Quote\nIn this country, parents tell me that they give their teenage daughters a present of what\&#39;s called &#34;double eyelid surgery&#34; which makes eyes more pronounced - &#34;less Asian&#34; is the truth of it. Why, I wonder, when Korean eyes seem so beautiful the way they are?\nThe retort that blares from the adverts on the train is that &#34;confidence in appearance brings positive energy which can be the foundation of happiness&#34;. Happiness - so easily found at the cut of a knife!\nExcept that, of course, it\&#39;s not. There is now a backlash, a slew of court cases where patients - or victims as they might be known - are suing doctors who re-arranged their faces, but not in a good way. One victim said when the bandages came off: &#34;This is not a human face. It is more revolting than monsters or aliens.&#34;\nKim Bok-Soon was persuaded to spend 30m Won (\u014117,320) for 15 surgeries on her face\nPart of the problem is that plastic surgery is so lucrative that unqualified doctors have been drawn in - or rather doctors qualified in other areas of quite different medicine. It\&#39;s alleged that procedures have been done by what are called &#34;ghost doctors&#34;. In one court case, it\&#39;s claimed that the advertised doctor slipped out of the operating room once the patient was under the anaesthetic and the job was then botched by the replacement surgeon.\nOn top of that, it\&#39;s emerged that some before-and-after photos have had a bit of surgery themselves - surgery of the Photoshop variety.\nThe upshot is that the Korean Association of Plastic Surgeons has called for tighter rules for doctors and for advertisers. They fear that the bad publicity is damaging the reputation of an industry which is largely well-run.\nBut they\&#39;re fighting against the tide. Plastic surgery is very profitable, even with prices that undercut the US and Europe. One of the big businesses in Gangnam, here in Seoul, prices &#34;eye-shape correction&#34; at 1.7m Korean Won. That\&#39;s about \u01411,000 ($1,500) for a 30-minute, simple procedure. It rises to 12m Won for a &#34;full-incision face lift&#34; - that\&#39;s about \u01417,000 ($11,000).\nSouth Korea plastic surgery\nIn response to a survey of 1,000 patients, run by the Korea Consumer Agency (KCA):\n70% of those questioned said they had a surgical procedure to improve their looks, and 14.5% said they believed it boosted their prospects for employment or promotion\nThe most popular procedure was the &#34;double-eyelid surgery&#34; - 67.8% of respondents said they undergone the procedure\n32.3% of those asked responded that the results of their procedures were &#34;unsatisfactory&#34;\nPlastic surgery is like an addiction - if you do the eyes, you want the nose\x94\nEnd Quote\nTranslation is increasingly needed. There\&#39;s a big market with a similar sense of vanity right on Korea\&#39;s doorstep: China. According to the reputable Joongang Daily here, two-thirds of the foreigners who came for plastic surgery to South Korea last year were from China, more than 16,000 customers. The press here says that some of the procedures have been so radical - so successful - that passport officials have not believed it\&#39;s the same person holding the passport.\nBut maybe Chinese people who aspire to film-star beauty or, for that matter, South Korean parents who think they can improve their daughters through the surgeon\&#39;s knife should reflect on one horror story going through the courts.\nA former beauty queen here had breast enhancement which went horribly wrong. After a series of infections, she ended up with one breast much bigger than the other.\nShe blames doctors for the medical failure but also for never saying to her: &#34;Look, you don\&#39;t need this.&#34; &#34;Plastic surgery is like an addiction,&#34; she said. &#34;If you do the eyes, you want the nose.\n&#34;And doctors don\&#39;t say, \&#39;You\&#39;re beautiful enough as you are.\&#39;&#34;\nJi Yeo\&#39;s photographs were first published as part of a series called Beauty Recovery Room\nMore from the Magazine\nIn 1962, Timmie Jean Lindsey became the first woman to receive silicone breast implants in a groundbreaking operation in Houston, Texas.

In Malawi, a research team is conducting the largest-ever study on children into the effects of indoor smoke and hopes its results will save millions of young lives, as our science reporter, Victoria Gill, discovered.\nEnnere\&#39;s eyes are watering. Smoke from the fire she is cooking on is filling her tiny, one-room house in a small village in the district of Chikwawa in the south of Malawi.\nIt is a traditional open fire on the floor of her hut, surrounded by three bricks to keep in the hot embers and on which to rest her cooking pot.\nShe and her two-year old daughter, who is gripping Ennere\&#39;s shoulder as she crouches over a warming pan of water, are breathing in the smoke.\nMost of the small houses here have no chimney. Some of the smoke escapes through the doorway, but there is no other ventilation. Smoke is filling the little girl\&#39;s lungs.\nWe\&#39;re interested in counting cases of pneumonia. We don\&#39;t want to count dead children\x94\nEnd Quote Dr Kevin Mortimer Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine\nThis happens every time Ennere cooks.\nLike 95% of people in Malawi, her family belong to what the World Health Organization calls the &#34;forgotten three billion &#34;, people who have to breathe polluted air in their homes and are being poisoned by their own cooking fires.\n&#34;Smoke basically clogs up children\&#39;s lungs making them more susceptible to infections like pneumonia, explains Dr Kevin Mortimer, one of the lead researchers from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine .\nIn Malawi, pneumonia is the number one killer of children under five.\nAccording to the WHO, throughout sub-Saharan Africa, almost one million children every year die from the disease.  Worldwide that number could be more than four million.\nThe stove being tested in this cooking-and-pneumonia trial has a battery-operated fan beneath the furnace\nRedesigning the stove on which millions cook, the researchers believe, could be the solution to cutting this death toll.\nThere are several different types of clean cook stove. The ones the team are testing use the same fuel as open fires, wood (or biomass) but they incorporate a battery-powered fan that blows air through a contained furnace.\nThis produces a more efficient, less smoky fire.\nThe Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine team intends to distribute 16,000 stoves in the north of Malawi, and here in Chikwawa in the south. It will be the largest trial of its type ever undertaken anywhere in the world.\nEnnere and her daughter have been recruited to the control group, meaning they will continue to use conventional cooking methods over a traditional open fire.\nThat might seem unfair, but it will allow researchers to compare their &#34;stove intervention&#34; with routine, smoky cooking practices.\nAt the end of the two-year study, during which the researchers will monitor the health of each child, every family involved will receive two of the cleaner, &#34;advanced-burning&#34; stoves.\nOne in every hundred children in Malawi dies from pneumonia before the age of five\nIf this team finds that the stoves they are testing prevent pneumonia, Dr Mortimer says this will be a definitive message for Malawi\&#39;s government, and policymakers around the world, that this is a priority for their investment.\nThe 9,000th child\nAt the nearby Chikwawa District Hospital, the toll that lung disease takes here becomes clear.\nChifundo Ndamala is one of the clinical staff working for the research project, providing care for children involved in the study, as well as recording and tracking every case of pneumonia.\nAs Dr Mortimer puts it: &#34;We\&#39;re interested in counting cases of pneumonia, not dead children.&#34;\nFor that reason, the team has employed health workers and invested in diagnostic tools and antibiotics, so every child in the study has access to the treatment they need if they do become ill.\nChifundo is attending to one of the children from the control group - a young boy of about two.\nHe smiles warmly at the little boy as he examines him, but the toddler is wide-eyed and clings to his mother as they sit together on the bare mattress of the hospital bed.\n&#34;He was diagnosed with severe pneumonia three months ago,&#34; Chifundo tells me. &#34;But he\&#39;s doing well, he\&#39;s responding to treatment now.&#34;\nMothers stay to care for their children at Chikwawa\&#39;s district hospital\nThis is a country where healthcare is basic - there are approximately 50,000 people for every doctor in Malawi. And staff here in the children\&#39;s ward have to work with the few resources they have to care for their young patients, some of whom are critically ill.\nBut this project does mean that Chifundo is on hand to help.\n&#34;This is not a place of comfort,&#34; says Dr Mortimer, &#34;but it is a place where people are doing their utmost to provide the best possible care with the resources they have.&#34;\nChifundo is even more optimistic.\n&#34;We\&#39;re able to treat children who will be the leaders of this nation one day,&#34; he says.\n&#34;It\&#39;s rewarding job; just seeing a child recover and go home, it\&#39;s good for the soul.&#34;\nDr Mortimer also hopes the study and the eventual publication of its findings will &#34;raise the profile&#34; of indoor smoke exposure.\n&#34;People should know,&#34; he says, &#34;that this is a condition that causes millions of deaths every year&#34;.\nMore on This Story\n21 SEPTEMBER 2010, SCIENCE &amp; ENVIRONMENT\nRelated Internet links\n&#39;, u&#39;NHS patients and private hospital referrals\nRelated Stories\nBill against \&#39;privatised\&#39; NHS backed\nNHS patients who get referred to private hospitals for two very common surgeries enjoy better results, Newsnight analysis has shown.\nLooking at knee and hip replacements, the only two procedures for which there is enough data, Newsnight found patients referred to private providers did better than patients of the same age, gender and prior health who were referred to NHS hospitals.\nThe analysis uses a dataset called &#34;Proms&#34;, which stands for &#34; patient reported outcome measures &#34;.\nThis is an unusual set of records which sets out to record how well patients feel. They respond to a detailed questionnaire about their health before an operation, then afterwards.\nBy comparing the two sets of results, we can benchmark - in detail - how well providers paid similar sums of money did in improving the lot of patients.\nProms also contains results for two other categories: groin hernia repair and varicose veins.\nAnalysis of both of these categories of care found that the private providers did better, too, but that the quantities of data are too small for the analysis to be reliable.\nAfter conducting regression analyses of the survey data, we can demonstrate how this affects patients.\nTake, for example, a hypothetical 70 year-old who reported that they had a low score on the general wellbeing measure on Proms - 50 out of 100 - because they need a hip replacement.\nIf they were to go to a public hospital they could expect a score after surgery of 78.9 out of 100.\nAt a private one, it would be 83.9 out of 100 - a gap of five points. For a similar patient seeking a knee replacement, the private-public gap would be around 3.4 points.\n\&#39;Puzzle on provision\&#39;\nIn both cases, the results are highly statistically significant.\nSince we have adjusted for gender, age and prior condition of the patient, we can say the difference is not explained by the slightly simpler set of cases that private providers tend to take on.\nBut remember that while, en masse, private providers may tend to do better than public ones, individual NHS providers may beat individual private ones.\nAnd this is only a small part of the puzzle on provision inside the NHS: it covers just two operations for a single year (albeit common ones).\nThere is, furthermore, existing academic research that suggests that specialist providers doing a few elective treatments often do beat the pack. This may explain it.\nStill: Watch this space.\nAs the amount of NHS provision that is outsourced has drifted up since the early 2000s, we will probably find other areas where new (and that might often mean private) providers tend to do better than legacy NHS hospitals.\nConversely, we will also confirm that there areas where patients report that traditional NHS providers are best. They have unique variety of services on-site.\nIf we can get more data which gives us good information on care quality we can, one hopes, work out which is which.\n&#39;, u&#39;Interesting NHS data no-one is looking at\nLast week, John Appleby, chief economist at the King\&#39;s Fund, wrote a cry of help.\nOne of the most interesting and important set of statistics in the NHS is being neglected. And he\&#39;s right to be annoyed.\nThe statistics - known as proms - are respected, cheap to collect and provide useful information.\nBut, since their initial proof of concept, he says, their use has progressed &#34;barely at all&#34;.\nI, for one, think this is a terrible shame because they - uniquely in the health service - relate to real care quality.\nProms stands for &#34;patient reported outcome measures&#34;.\nFancier stuff\nBefore some of the more popular forms of elective surgery, patients fill in a form explaining how they feel.\nThen, after the operation, they fill them in again. Using that, we can say who is good at getting patients to feel better.\nWhy is this so important?\nWell, most statistics on this kind of care are about mortality. Quite often, we struggle to say more than &#34;well, they didn\&#39;t die&#34;.\nBut using proms, we can very easily see whether care quality is rising. And we can also do fancier stuff.\nFor example, we can see whether GPs - newly empowered by the Andrew Lansley reforms - now commission more operations from very good providers and fewer from the very bad.\nIf his market-based reforms are working, they should be.\nSo far, that is not very apparent.\nThe share of hip replacement operations commissioned from good providers rose marginally from 10.2% to 11.5% in 2013-14 - the first year of the reforms.\nBut it did not fall at the worst providers, sticking at about 10%.\nThat is actually a very tiny amount better than before the reforms - but we\&#39;ll have to wait to see if we get any significant movement.\nWe can also see evidence of excess treatment within proms.\nOvertreatment means unnecessary surgery and drugs. It\&#39;s both expensive and genuinely terrible for patients.\nFor example, take hernias - that\&#39;s when muscles near your groin tear, allowing a portion of your intestines to poke through.\nIt is a condition that affects men, in particular. There were 60,000 groin hernia repair operations in England in 2013-14.\nIt has historically been treated with surgery - usually by shoving a small piece of plastic mesh between the muscles and intestine.\nUnneeded treatment\nThe principal idea is to prevent dangerous complications known as &#34;strangulation&#34; or &#34;obstruction&#34;.\nBut that is now reckoned rare for men with few symptoms.\nIn 2006, the Journal of the American Medical Association advised that &#34;watchful waiting&#34; was advised for men &#34;with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic&#34; hernias.\nYet according to proms, about a fifth of hernia repairs are for men who report no or minimal discomfort on the proms test.\nFurthermore, 85% of them report feeling worse after the treatment.\nThat\&#39;s about \u014150m of possibly unneeded treatment right there, hidden in a survey.\nTim Hughes, a doctor at Kirkbymoorside in Yorkshire, has recently been using proms to encourage hernia patients to consider whether they really need their treatment - and most decide not to have it.\nWe should be watching proms to see how that progresses in the coming years.\n\&#39;Cherry picking\&#39;\nWe can also use proms to see whether private providers operating inside the NHS are &#34;cherry picking&#34; - that is to say, getting easier patients.\nBecause the NHS has an inflexible pricing structure, they often get as much money for treating easy cases as slightly harder ones.\nYou can use proms to do more sophisticated analysis, but - for a start - the average groin hernia repair patient, at the average NHS provider, has a health score of 77 out of 100.\nAt private providers, it\&#39;s 81.\nThat\&#39;s not much, but enough to say they do tend to take slightly easier cases.\nBut the private providers also do slightly better by them, since the improvement in scores tends to be a bit higher at the private providers.\nThey get an average improvement of 8.8 points. For state providers, it\&#39;s 7.8.\nProms is perhaps the most interesting data on the NHS that no-one is looking at.\nGiven how sterile much of our discussion of the health service is, Prof Appleby is right: that\&#39;s a real shame.\n&#39;, u&#39;Suicide prevention is \&#39;everybody\&#39;s business\&#39;\nBy Jane Dreaper Health correspondent, BBC News\nJames Wentworth-Stanley, who took his own life at the age of 21, pictured with his mother Clare Milford Haven\n\&#39;First aid\&#39; suicide prevention course\nThe death of Charlotte Bevan and her newborn daughter in Bristol has prompted a review into the care she was given.\nThere are often questions about how such tragic situations might be avoided when family and friends become aware that a loved one is slipping into a decline.\nTo talk about this most sensitive of subjects, I met a polo player and former social editor at Tatler magazine, Clare Milford Haven, for a coffee in a quiet cafe at Brighton railway station.\nHer eldest son, James Wentworth-Stanley, was sporty, bright and good-looking.\nHe took his own life at the age of just 21 in 2006.\nHe was in his second year of studying Spanish and business.\nDescribed by his mother as &#34;a doer&#34;, he also played in a rugby team and held down a hotel bar job.\nJames had returned to student life in Newcastle a few days after a minor operation had led to a change in mood.\n\&#39;Horrendous and alarming\&#39;\nClare Milford Haven told me: &#34;I wish I\&#39;d kept him under my watchful eye.\n&#34;I couldn\&#39;t force his hand about returning to Newcastle - but I regret it, because then he took his own life.\n&#34;It was the most horrendous and alarming experience.\n&#34;There was absolutely no warning sign at all - we didn\&#39;t see it coming.

He had been in contact with a GP, and a walk-in centre - which sent him to A&amp;E; two days before his suicide.\nHis mother has harnessed her pain to help others.\nClare Milford Haven helps to run the Alliance of Suicide Prevention Charities (TASC).\nSometimes rules of confidentiality mean people don\&#39;t get the help they might need \x94\nEnd Quote Chris Brown Grassroots Suicide Prevention\nOne of her goals is to set up a network of centres near hospitals.\nCalled James\&#39; Place, these would offer urgent face-to-face support for patients who are experiencing a crisis but are not in touch with mental health services.\nClare hopes the idea will be piloted in West London as well as in Brighton and Hove.\nShe said: &#34;We\&#39;d like to have a hierarchy of staff - from volunteers to highly trained clinicians. But the atmosphere would be a non-clinical one.\n&#34;It\&#39;s my dream that this would fill those very vital gaps in services.&#34;\nWe drive to a nearby library, where 11 people have gathered for a course called Safe Talk, or &#34;Suicide Alertness For Everyone&#34;.\nThe audience - mostly community workers - watch and discuss video clips which demonstrate how to ask someone who is suffering a very simple but direct question: &#34;Could you be thinking of suicide?&#34;\nThe message behind the course is the importance of keeping someone who is  vulnerable safe, and connecting them with services.\nThis might involve, for example, taking someone to a pharmacist or GP with any medicine they have stockpiled.\n\&#39;People have doubts\&#39;\nDuring a break, the instructor Chris Brown tells me how the charity she co-founded, Grassroots Suicide Prevention, is working to reduce what had been a very high suicide rate in Brighton.\nShe said: &#34;We\&#39;re trying to make Brighton a \&#39;suicide-safe\&#39; town - it\&#39;s all about education, awareness and training residents with brief courses like this one.\n&#34;Research tells us that people considering suicide have doubts about it. It shouldn\&#39;t be regarded as an inevitable outcome.\n&#34;Part of a person considering ending their life wants to live, as well as the part of them that wants to die.\n&#34;But sometimes rules of confidentiality can mean that people don\&#39;t get the help they might need from friends or family - this can result in a tragic outcome.&#34;\nAdvice to doctors from the Medical Defence Union says they should encourage patients to allow friends and family to get involved - and they can listen to the concerns of loved ones.\nTechnology could hold some promise here - Grassroots has launched an app called Stay Alive, which aims to point desperate people to help quickly.\nBut the Samaritans had to suspend their app called Radar, after criticism that its monitoring of tweets was intrusive and could encourage bullies.\nThis is an area in which any support has to be offered carefully and sensitively.\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;NHS should welcome \&#39;citizen whistleblowers\&#39;\nBy Anna Bradley Chair of Healthwatch England\nThe NHS should welcome reports from \&#39;third parties\&#39;, Ms Bradley says\nExercise guidelines \&#39;hard to meet\&#39;\nPeople who see something going wrong in the NHS should be able to report their concerns, even if they haven\&#39;t been directly affected, according to Anna Bradley, the chair of patients\&#39; group Healthwatch England.\nIn this week\&#39;s Scrubbing Up, she says the NHS often doesn\&#39;t let witnesses file complaints - an omission akin to preventing people reporting an abandoned bag at an airport because they don\&#39;t have the owner\&#39;s permission.\nWe know that patients are reluctant to make a fuss when standards slip on hospital wards.\nMany simply don\&#39;t know how to make a complaint, others are actually scared of the consequences.\nYet we often hear complaints referred to as \&#39;gold dust\&#39; by hospital bosses in terms of improving services.\nYou would think then that health and care organisations would be eager to hear from anyone who wanted to report a concern or complaint.\nHowever, our research suggests that tens of thousands of incidents are slipping under the radar because those who witness poor care and try to report it are being told, in one particular case, to &#34;mind their own business&#34;.\n\&#39;Civic-minded individuals\&#39;\nResponding to a Freedom of Information request, a third of hospitals across England told us that they don\&#39;t record complaints from &#34;third parties&#34;, ie those that witness rather than personally experiencing poor care.\nMany of the hospital trusts that replied incorrectly stated that such complaints cannot be investigated without the permission of the patient.\nContinue reading the main story\n\x93Start Quote\nIf a passer-by reports an abandoned bag in an airport, the staff don\&#39;t say: &#34;I\&#39;m sorry sir, but do you have the permission of the bag owner.&#34;\x94\nEnd Quote\nOthers said they record such incidents as informal feedback only, with no follow-up provided to the courageous and civic minded individuals complaining on behalf of vulnerable patients.\nIn the worst cases some hospitals just flat out said they don\&#39;t record these complaints.\nEven where these reports are recorded, they are often not included in formal stats allowing hospitals so their complaints data doesn\&#39;t tell the true story.\nFor me this is symptomatic of a much bigger problem around complaints handling in the NHS and social care services.\nThe fact that doctors and nurses would rather tell one of these &#34;citizen whistleblowers&#34; they can\&#39;t complain because they don\&#39;t tick the right box or have the permission to make a complaint is just wrong.\nIf a passer-by reports an abandoned bag in an airport, the staff don\&#39;t say: &#34;I\&#39;m sorry sir, but do you have the permission of the bag owner.&#34; Rather they are thanked for their vigilance.\nIf the policy makers and politicians are serious about driving culture change in the NHS then more needs to be done to wipe out this \&#39;compute says no\&#39; attitude and encourage staff to welcome feedback - positive and negative.\n\&#39;Long hard look\&#39;\nWith the secretary of state for health\&#39;s update on progress against the recommendations of the Francis inquiry expected in the next few weeks, I implore him to take a long hard look at the complaints question.\nIn our report, \&#39;Suffering in Silence\&#39;, we set out a vision for streamlining and refocusing the complaints system around what people want.\nFirstly, the system needs to make it easier for people to complain, including institutions understanding that everyone, including third parties, has the right to raise concerns.\nSecondly, every case should be dealt with compassionately, with a speedy, personalised response that actually addresses the poor experience and includes an outline of what happens next.\nLastly, those who fail to up their game must be held to account by being put into &#34;special measures&#34; by the regulators, issued with financial penalties and ultimately being shut down and replaced.\nIn short, it\&#39;s time for the health and social care sector to get serious about complaints, and stop finding loopholes to avoid having to face up to their mistakes.\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;Phillip Hughes: How is the brain injured?\nBy James Gallagher &amp; Philippa Roxby Health reporters, BBC News\nPhillip Hughes played in 26 Tests for Australia before his death at the age of 25\nPhillip Hughes collapsed after being hit by a cricket ball at the top of his neck and the base of the skull.\nOne of the major arteries into the brain split and caused massive bleeding.\nThe brain is a very delicate and vulnerable organ, which is surrounded by the skull - a defensive wall of bone - and a cushioning fluid.\nBut it is not a simple case of the brain having specific weak spots.\n&#34;The brain is protected by the skull, but the upper neck is vulnerable,&#34; said Peter Hutchinson, a professor of neurosurgery at University of Cambridge.\nHe told the BBC: &#34;We evolved to enable a neck with a lot of movement, but the consequence is a risk of injury to the vessels from excessive movement or direct trauma.&#34;\nThe vertebral arteries run up both sides of the neck and the blow from the ball caused a dissection, in which the artery ruptures.\nAntonio Belli, professor of trauma neurosurgery at the University of Birmingham, said: &#34;The vertebral arteries supply the brain stem, which controls breathing and heart rhythm, so I think that could be why he stopped breathing immediately.&#34;\nHow the brain is fed by arteries (in red) and veins (in blue) in the head and neck\nTypes of injury\nWhile vertebral artery dissections are rare, there are two common types of brain injury known as &#34;focal&#34; and &#34;diffuse&#34;.\nFocal injuries tend to be caused by falls and assaults. They are the result of a damage to one area of the brain, which results in a blood clot.\nThis occupies space and causes pressure on the surrounding brain, starving the organ of oxygen leading to brain cells dying. It is treated by removing the clot.\nHowever, damage may not be confined to just the site of the impact - known as a &#34;coup injury&#34;.\nThe brain floats inside the skull so can collide with the side of the skull opposite the impact causing a &#34;contra-coup injury&#34;.\nThe front of Olympic rower James Cracknell\&#39;s brain was damaged when he was struck on the back of the head while cycling.\nWidespread\nThe other class of injury is largely the result of high speed road accidents.\nThe latest model of cricket helmet, which is said to be more protective, worn by New Zealand cricketer Ish Sodhi\nIn diffuse injuries the damage is spread across the brain, which becomes swollen.\nThe pressure builds in the tight confines of the skull and the flow of blood can be impaired.\nTreatment requires lowering the pressure in the brain.\nIt is also possible to damage the brain without a direct blow to the head.\nThe brain sits in fluid inside the skull and can bounce around if there is enough force.\nIn something like severe whiplash the brain can be shaken around the skull, even though no blow is delivered.\nMr Belli told the BBC: &#34;Often what does the damage is not the direct impact, but rotational forces.\n&#34;You could argue from an evolutionary point of view, we\&#39;re well designed to withstand a direct blow, but not engineered well to withstand the rotational forces in a road traffic accident.&#34;\nThinner walls\nThe skull itself does have stronger and weaker parts.\nA region called the pterion, close to the ears, is the thinnest part of the skull so is most vulnerable to fracture.\nBut the relatively reinforced forehead and back of the skull can still be damaged.\n&#34;They may be thicker parts of the skull, but you can still fracture them if you transmit enough force,&#34; Prof Hutchinson noted.\n&#34;There isn\&#39;t a safe point or a weak point, you get a lot of damage from the way the force travels through the head,&#34; added Mr Belli.\nLasting damage\nDamage varies hugely from one patient to another - one patient who has a seemingly severe injury can show better recovery than injuries which appear minor.\nProf Hutchinson said it the lasting damage depended on where the damage was caused as &#34;some areas are more critical&#34;.\n&#34;Bleeding in the motor cortex can result in paralysis while damage to the visual cortex would result in blindness.&#34;\nHe said sport was not taking head injury seriously enough, but changes in American football were driving reform.\n&#34;In terms of sport, the most controversial is boxing because it is a deliberate act, horse riding creates a lot of serious injuries, and rugby increasingly so.\n&#34;There are racing drivers who have had an accident in the early part of the weekend, raced the whole weekend and not remembered a thing.&#34;\n&#34;People need to be aware of brain injury.&#34;\nMore on This Story\n&#39;, u&#39;How the West is cutting teen pregnancy\nBy Keith Moore BBC News\nChristingle: The Christmas tradition that only got going in the 1960s\nTeenage pregnancy is a problem developed Western nations have been battling for decades - and though it sometimes goes unnoticed they have made huge progress.\n&#34;Here\&#39;s a story of utter irresponsibility: About one-third of American girls become pregnant as teenagers,&#34; wrote columnist Nicholas Kristof in the New York Times recently.\nIt seems like a shockingly high number. And eight years ago it was accurate.\nIn 2006, this was the cumulative risk of a teenager becoming pregnant once between the ages of 13 and 19. It was calculated by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a non-profit organisation, using data for births and abortions and an estimate for the number of miscarriages.\nTruly one of the US\&#39;s great success stories over the past two decades\x94\nEnd Quote Bill Albert National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy\nBut when the same formula is used with the most recent figures, from 2010, it indicates that the number of teenage American girls becoming pregnant is now less than one in four, a reduction on track with changes over the past two decades.\nBill Albert, chief programme officer for the National Campaign, says teen pregnancy and birth rates have been declining in the US &#34;almost without interruptions&#34; for nearly 20 years, after peaking in the early 1990s.\nThey are down among all racial and ethnic groups in all 50 states.\nHe describes it as &#34;truly one of the US\&#39;s great success stories over the past two decades&#34;.\nIndeed, the preliminary data for teen birth rates in 2013 suggests there has been another 22% drop in the rate of 15-to-19-year-olds giving birth since 2010.\nAlthough abortion data is not yet available, Albert thinks it is highly likely that the rate of teenage pregnancy has declined from its 2010 level. It could be that less than a fifth of American teenage girls are now getting pregnant once.\n&#34;We do know that three things are happening in the US - the teen pregnancy rate is going down, the teen abortion rate is going down and the teen birth rate is going down,&#34; Albert says.\nWhy is this?\n&#34;Teen pregnancy drops in one of two ways - either teens are having less sex overall or the teens who are sexually active are using contraceptives and using them better,&#34; says Heather Boonstra from the Guttmacher Institute, a non-governmental organisation which researches sexual and reproductive health.\n&#34;What we have found looking back at just these two behaviours, is that overwhelmingly it is due to better contraceptive use.&#34;\nThe reasons why people are using contraceptives better are not clear-cut, Boonstra says.\nColorado\&#39;s birth control success\nReasons she cites include greater awareness of condoms following the aids crisis, changing norms about the age people in developed countries are getting married and having children (which lowers the planned pregnancy rate), and the internet making information more accessible.\nWhen it comes to the influence of sex education in schools, Boonstra says that while there is evidence it has helped increase teenagers\&#39; use of contraception and lower their number of partners, it does not explain the declines in teenage pregnancy entirely.\n&#34;These declines have happened across all 50 states and here in the United States different states and different school districts have different policies about their sex education programmes, and so programmes are important but there\&#39;s a lot more that\&#39;s going on here because otherwise we would have seen variations across the nation,&#34; she says.\nThere has been conflicting research about whether reality TV programmes such as MTV\&#39;s &#34;16 and Pregnant&#34; help prevent teenage pregnancy or glamorise it.\nDespite teenage pregnancy in the US being at historic lows, it\&#39;s still the case that a much higher proportion of US teenagers have babies than their counterparts in other countries in Western Europe - as Kristof points out.\nBoth Boonstra and Albert say there are various reasons for the higher US teenage birth rate, including less access to contraception, the US\&#39;s racial and ethnic makeup, norms around the best times to start a family and the prevalence of abstinence-only sex education programmes in the US.\nThe reduction in the numbers of teenagers having children isn\&#39;t just restricted to the US, says Prof Roger Ingham from the University of Southampton.\n&#34;In most of the countries in Western Europe, the rates have been going down steadily over the last few years,&#34; he says. The teenage pregnancy rate in the UK is the highest in Western Europe, which may explain why it has been faster in the UK than elsewhere.\nIngham, who advised the UK government for 12 years on its strategy to reduce teen pregnancy, says the declines are not due to teenagers having less sex.  As in the US, the improvement appears to be related to more widespread use of contraceptives, which Ingham says is due to better sex education in schools.\nIn terms of abortion impacting the birth rate, he says there is a mixed picture in the countries where there is good data.\nThe Netherlands has a low teenage abortion rate and a low conception rate, Ingham says, while Sweden has a similar birth rate but a higher conception rate - in other words, a higher proportion of pregnancies end in termination.\nIn the UK, the birth rate has gone down more quickly than the conception rate, as a higher proportion of those who are pregnant are choosing to have an abortion than in previous years.\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine\&#39;s email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox\nMore on This Story\nA city government in China has been using security guards to pose as police officers.\nShare this page\nDid Vladimir Putin gamble on high oil prices lasting for ever?\nMost Popular\n&#39;]
