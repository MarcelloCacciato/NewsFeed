Many were airlifted off the nearby mountain but thousands more who came later found themselves trapped.\\n\\'High-value targets\\'\\nThe attack on Sinjar was one of the reasons the US began air strikes against IS positions in Iraq in August. It expanded its air campaign into Syria the following month.\\nMartin Dempsey: \"These are high-value targets, senior leadership\"\\nGen Martin Dempsey, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the air strikes that had killed the IS leaders were designed to hamper the Islamist group\\'s ability to conduct attacks, supply fighters and finance operations.\\nGen Dempsey told the Wall Street Journal that the loss of IS leaders was \"disruptive to their planning and command and control\".\\nHe added: \"These are high-value targets, senior leadership.\"\\nPentagon officials said that between 3 and 9 December, US air strikes killed Abd al-Basit, head of IS military operations in Iraq, and Haji Mutazz, a key aide of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\\nThey added that in late November another strike killed Radwin Talib, IS governor of the northern Iraqi city of Mosul.\\nOther defence officials said a number of senior and mid-level IS commanders had also died in air strikes, and that they believed this was beginning to significantly weaken the group\\'s leadership structure.\\nMore on This Story\\nThe battle for guns at university\\nMost Popular\\n', u'Cairns deaths: Eight children found in Australian home\\nMurray Street in the Manoora suburb of Cairns has been closed off by police\\nEight children have been found dead at a house in Cairns in northern Queensland, say Australian police.\\nPolice said a 34-year-old woman had been taken to hospital with stab wounds but was stable.\\nThe details of the incident and the woman\\'s relationship to the children, aged between 18 months and 15 years, are not yet clear.\\nAustralian reports say the children were stabbed but police have not confirmed this.\\nAustralian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in a statement it was an \"unspeakable crime\", and that all parents would feel \"gut-wrenching sadness at what has happened\".\\nBruno Asnicar of Cairns Police said that the scenes his officers had witnessed were \"extremely distressing\"\\nThe house in the Manoora suburb has been cordoned off and detectives are searching the yard.\\nPolice have said it was a \"tragic event\" but there was no cause for public concern.\\nThey have not made any arrests, but said the injured woman was assisting with their investigations.\\nThe BBC\\'s Jon Donnison in Sydney says it appears police are not looking for any suspects.\\nPolice have been comforting shocked local residents outside the house\\nThe Australian Associated Press news agency quoted a woman as saying she was the injured woman\\'s cousin and that the children were siblings.\\nCairns Detective Inspector Bruno Asnicar told reporters he could not confirm whether the children were from the same family.\\nHe said police currently believed there were eight children involved but \"that may go up or down\" as the house was searched.\\n\"These events are extremely distressing for everyone, of course, and police officers aren\\'t immune to that, we\\'re human beings as well,\" he said.\\nAAP reporter Cleo Lane at the scene told the BBC residents were standing in the street in shock.\\nQueensland Police said in a statement earlier that they were called to a residence in Murray Street at 11.20 local time (01:20 GMT) following reports of a woman with serious injuries.\\n\"During an examination of the residence police located the bodies of the children, all aged between 18 months and 15 years,\" said the statement.\\nQueensland Premier Campbell Newman said he was \"deeply saddened and shocked\" by the events.\\n\"Indeed, the whole Cairns community and the people of Queensland will feel the effects of this tragedy, particularly at a time of year when families come together.\"\\nMore on This Story\\n', u'Sony hack: White House views attack as security issue\\nThe Interview stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as journalists enlisted to kill Kim Jong-un\\nSony scraps The Interview worldwide Watch\\nA cyber attack on Sony Pictures that forced the cancellation of a major film release is being seen as a serious national security matter, the US says.\\nA White House spokesman said the US believed the hacking was the work of a \"sophisticated actor\" -

Russia\\'s behaviour needs a pragmatic solution, a united, common position.\"\\nPoland, bordering on Ukraine, has long had tense relations with Russia, and is among the most vocal critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\nCrimea targeted\\nPro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine still have heavy weapons including tanks and rockets, despite demands by Ukraine and the West for them to disarm. Continuing clashes in the Donetsk region have undermined peace efforts.\\nUnder the latest measures against Russia, all EU tour operators will be barred from operating in Crimea and European investment there will be banned. Russia annexed Crimea in March.\\nItaly\\'s Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said \"we must work with Russia to push it out of Ukraine\".\\nFighting continues in eastern Ukraine, despite appeals by the EU\\nAnd EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker stressed that the EU\\'s channels of communication with Russia must remain open.\\nThere was much surprise among the summit journalists that Mr Tusk managed to reduce the expected two-day summit to one afternoon and evening. Usually EU summits go on hours longer than planned, often into the early morning.\\nInvestment plan\\nThe other main topic was Mr Juncker\\'s plan to generate \\x80315bn (\\u0141250bn; $392bn) of private investment for infrastructure projects in the EU.\\nIt got the leaders\\' approval, and the aim is to launch it next June.\\nMr Juncker said the commission would \"look favourably\" on government participation in big investment schemes, and would \"neutralise\" national contributions to the new fund. That suggests more lenient deficit targets for governments that boost investment.\\nItaly, burdened by colossal debts and high unemployment, warmly welcomed the Juncker plan.\\nMr Renzi said investment decisions would involve \"politicians, not only technocrats\" and he stressed that for years Italy had been urging flexibility in reaching budget targets set by the commission.\\n\"Growth and not only austerity is the legacy of the Italian presidency [of the EU],\" he said.\\nHe and French President Francois Hollande - both centre-left leaders  - have urged Germany and other pro-austerity states to encourage much-needed growth, by allowing a monetary stimulus in the eurozone.\\nMore on This Story\\n17 DECEMBER 2014, INSIDE EUROPE BLOG\\nFrom other news sites\\nThe battle for guns at university\\nMost Popular\\n', u'Insular US Secret Service needs external boss - report\\nThe White House is meant to be one of the most secure sites in the US\\nWhite House security lapses detailed\\nThe US Secret Service, which guards the US president, is too insular and must recruit its next head externally, a review prompted by a White House security breach says.\\nThe report, a summary of which was released by the Homeland Security Department, said the agency needed more plainclothes and uniformed staff.\\nIt added that the White House needed a new, taller fence.\\nThe review came after an intruder with a knife entered the building.\\nOmar Gonzalez, a former US soldier, was apprehended deep inside the presidential residence in September after he had scaled a fence around the building and evaded several guards - including one with an attack dog.\\nJulia Pearson, the Secret Service director at the time, resigned partly as a result of this breach.\\nThe Secret Service is tasked with guarding the US president, as well as several senior government officials.\\nAccording to an executive summary of the independent review, the agency\\'s next director \"will have to make difficult choices, identifying clear priorities for the organisation and holding management accountable for any failure to achieve those priorities\".\\nThe Secret Service director at the time, Julia Pierson, has since resigned\\n\"Only a director from outside the [Secret] Service, removed from organisational traditions and personal relationships, will be able to do the honest top-to-bottom reassessment this will require.\"\\nThe review also said a better fence should be built \"as soon as possible\", recommending one that was several feet higher and curved outwards, making it harder to scale.\\nHowever, the review noted that the problems in the agency \"go deeper than a new fence can fix\".

These are likely the result of biomass burning in these regions.\\nIt is possible to see spikes, too, on the eastern seaboard of the US and over China. These probably include the additional emissions of CO2 that come from industrialisation.\\n\"We\\'re very early into the mission and collecting data, yet as we show, we can take five weeks of that information and give you a quick picture of global carbon dioxide,\" said deputy project scientist Annmarie Eldering.\\n\"It really suggests to us that OCO-2 will be very useful for finding out about where carbon dioxide is coming from and being taken back up around the globe,\" she told BBC News.\\nThe US space agency researcher presented the maps here at the American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting in San Francisco.\\nSources and sinks\\nThe satellite was launched this year as a replacement for an earlier venture that was destroyed in 2009 when its rocket failed soon after lift-off.\\nOCO-2\\'s key objective is to trace the global geographic distribution of CO2 in the atmosphere - measuring its presence down through the column of air to the planet\\'s surface.\\nScientists want to know how exactly the greenhouse gas cycles through the Earth system - the carbon cycle.\\nHumans add something like 40 billion tonnes of the gas to the atmosphere every year, principally from the burning of fossil fuels.\\nBut the ultimate destination of this carbon dioxide is uncertain.  About half is thought to be absorbed into the oceans, with the rest pulled down into land \"sinks\".\\nIt is hoped OCO-2 can describe those draw-down locations in much more detail.\\nEven with this snapshot, scientists can see that some of their existing models will have to be revised.\\nArtist\\'s impression: The  OCO-2 satellite has an initial mission of two years\\nAs part of its presentation, the observatory team showed off a special targeting mode that it can employ on OCO-2.\\nThis involves swinging the satellite so that its spectrometer instrument can scan a restricted location in very high resolution.\\nCurrently, these places are ones where the project has sophisticated ground equipment to gather measurements that can then validate OCO-2\\'s observations from orbit.  But ultimately, the lessons learned could allow the mission to make detailed surveys at other sites, such as megacities known be big emitters.\\n\"I think the answer to that is \\'yes\\', and there are discussions going on now as to whether we can increase the number of places that we can target to look at other interesting locations.\\n\"But more importantly, though, we are all hoping there will be a follow-on mission called OCO-3, which would directly provide that flexibility in operations.\"\\nThe Orbiting Carbon Observatory has been spoken of as the forerunner of satellite missions that would seek to gain the information needed to patrol climate treaties, by helping to check that promises made by nations on carbon curbs were being kept.\\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos\\nMore on This Story\\n', u'New record depth for deepest fish\\nBy Rebecca Morelle Science Correspondent, BBC News, San Francisco\\nThe fish moves in from the bottom-left of the image towards the baited lander\\n\\'Supergiant\\' found in deepest sea\\nA new record has been set for the world\\'s deepest fish.\\nThe bizarre-looking creature, which is new to science, was filmed 8,145m beneath the waves, beating the previous depth record by nearly 500m.\\nSeveral other new species of fish were also caught on camera, as well as huge crustaceans called supergiants.\\nThe animals were discovered during an international expedition to the Mariana Trench, which lies almost 11km down in the Pacific Ocean.\\nThe 30-day voyage took place from the Schmidt Ocean Institute\\'s research vessel, Falkor, and is the most comprehensive survey of world\\'s deepest place ever undertaken.\\nThe Hadal Ecosystem Studies (Hades) team deployed unmanned landers more than 90 times to depths that ranged between 5,000m and 10,600m.

It\\'s not OK just to fire a person because they\\'re fat, if they\\'re doing their job properly.\"\\nThe Danish courts asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to clarify whether obesity was a disability.\\nThe ECJ ruled that if the obesity of the worker \"hinders the full and effective participation of that person in professional life on an equal basis with other workers\", then obesity can fall within the concept of \"disability\".\\nRulings from the European Court of Justice are binding for all EU member nations.\\nThe courts in Denmark will now have to assess Mr Kaltoft\\'s weight to see if his case can be classed as a disability.\\nAnalysis by Clive Coleman, BBC\\'s legal correspondent\\nToday\\'s ruling was of great interest to employers across Europe. The judgement makes no direct link between Body Mass Index and obesity, but is a powerful statement that an obese worker whose weight hinders their performance at work is entitled to disability protection.\\nThat will mean employers must, on a case by case basis, make reasonable adjustments such as providing larger chairs or special car parking, and protect such employees from verbal harassment.\\nBut there are wider implications. Providers of goods and services such as shops, cinemas and restaurants will also have to make reasonable adjustments for their customers, which might include things like special seating arrangements.\\nThe key concept here is that adjustments must be \"reasonable\" - so it may be deemed reasonable for a Premier League football club to make two seats available for someone disabled through obesity, but not for a small, non-league club.\\nObesity, particularly what is sometimes known as morbid or severe and complex obesity, can be a particularly sensitive subject.\\nEmployers and service providers will have to take care not to make assumptions about the needs of an obese worker or customer.\\n\\'Wider seats\\'\\nJane Deville Almond, the chairwoman of the British Obesity Society, said obesity should not be classed as a disability.\\nShe told the BBC: \"I think the downside would be that if employers suddenly have to start ensuring that they\\'ve got wider seats, larger tables, more parking spaces for people who are obese, I think then we\\'re just making the situation worse.\\nEmployers could be required to make their offices more accessible for obese employees\\n\"[It is] implying that people have no control over the condition, rather than something that can be greatly improved by changing behaviour.\"\\nPaul Callaghan, head of employment law at international law firm Taylor Wessing, said the ruling does not change UK law.\\n\"The European Court of Justice has ruled that obesity itself is not a disability, but that the effects of it can be.\\n\"As such, workers who suffer from, for example, joint problems, depression, or diabetes - specifically because of their size - will be protected by the European Equal Treatment Framework Directive and cannot be dismissed because of their weight.\"\\nEmployers\\' responsibility\\nAudrey Williams, employment law partner at Eversheds, said the mere fact someone is obese is not enough to make them disabled.\\n\"What the court are saying is that obesity is not protected unless it hinders professional life.\"\\nShe said the ruling would increase awareness among employers of their responsibility towards obese employees in the workplace.\\nThis could include making reasonable adjustments to working arrangements, seating arrangements or making access to the office easier.\\nHowever, Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said the ruling had opened a can of worms for UK employers.\\n\"They will be required to make adjustments to their furniture and doors and whatever is needed for very large people.\\n\"I believe it will also cause friction in the workplace between obese people and other workers.\"\\nOne in four people in the UK is classified as obese.\\nMore on This Story\\n', u'print\\nAlbert Ebosse: New tests claim Cameroonian died after beating\\nNew post-mortem tests indicate Cameroonian footballer Albert Ebosse died as a result of a beating rather than being hit by a projectile.\\nThe JS Kabylie striker died in August after his side lost a league match.\\nFindings by the Algerian authorities stated that the 24-year-old was killed by a sharp projectile thrown by fans.\\nBut pathologist Andre Moune told BBC World TV: \"When you see the injuries to his shoulders, the only way that can be explained is by a physical attack.\"\\nThe Cameroonian carried out the tests at the request of Ebosse\\'s family.\\nHe reported the player received \"a blow to the head\" that caused \"an indentation of the skull\" that impacted his brain and that he had suffered upper body injuries indicating \"signs of struggle\".\\nOther signs of violence included \"rupture of cervical vertebrae\" and a wound to the shoulder.\\nHis findings have been sent to Algerian and Cameroonian authorities for further action.\\nMoune added: \"Shortly after his death, we saw a video of Ebosse, after the match, surrounded by police and leaving the pitch to enter the dressing room.\\n\"We didn\\'t see anything happen to him on the pitch or anything that prevented him leaving the pitch because of a missile.\\n\"It can\\'t be a slate tile, as the Algerians stated in their report, because if someone threw a tile, even at high speed, it couldn\\'t cause such severe wounds like the ones I found on the body.\\n\"For such an object to break through into the skull, it needs a heavy strength.

This applies to both rich and poor families and across almost all regions.\\nAccording to Ucas, two decades ago there was no gender gap, but this has now become one of the most distinctive features of applications.\\nAmong 18-year-olds, the numbers of women going to university is continuing to rise more quickly than their male counterparts.\\nIn some constituencies the male entry rates are even lower. In Bristol South only 11% of 18-year-old men go on to university.\\nIn contrast there are constituencies where more than half of female school leavers go straight to university.\\nUcas says the gender gap in entry rates is the equivalent of 32,000 \"missing\" male students.\\nRegional differences\\nWhile the gap between male and female is at its widest ever, the gap between rich and poor is at its lowest.\\nRecord numbers of disadvantaged students are getting places in higher education, rising by 11% compared with last year.\\nThese students were particularly likely to enter with BTEC qualifications, rather than A-levels.\\nFor young applicants in England, 85% were accepted for a university place this year\\nBut regional differences remain across the UK. Young people in London and Northern Ireland are the most likely to enter university - those in Wales and the South West of England have the lowest entry rates.\\nThere are even lower figures for Scotland, but these are incomplete because Ucas does not cover admissions for all Scottish higher education.\\nThere are even wider local differences - with some places having average entry rates below 15% while others are above 50%.\\nBuyers\\' market\\nThe admissions figures also show the growing competition between universities to attract students.\\nUniversities are making more offers than ever before, 1.8 million this year, with students with high predicted grades getting four or five offers.\\nStudents without A or A* grades at A-level were more likely this year to have got into a selective \"higher tariff\" university. For students with three B grades, 35% got places into a top-tier university, compared with 32% last year and 17% in 2011.\\nAmong students with BBC grades, 15% got places at higher tariff universities, compared with 6% in 2011.\\nFor applicants with DDE grades, 12% got into \"medium tariff\" universities and 58% found a place at a \"lower tariff\" university.\\nAcross all types of university, the Ucas figures show that 85% of 18-year-old applicants from England were accepted for a place somewhere.\\nMary Curnock Cook, Ucas chief executive, said the increase in university entrance by disadvantaged students was a \"stunning account of social change\".\\n\"These trends are pushing the difference in entry rates between rich and poor to historic lows,\" she said.\\nNicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said the rising number of applications represented the end of the volatility that followed the increase in tuition fees.\\n\"It suggests a return to stability in university applications following the changes and dip in 2012,\" she said.\\nUniversities Minister Greg Clark said: \"For the first time ever over half a million students have entered higher education, with entry rates for students from disadvantaged backgrounds increasing by over 10% to its highest ever levels across the UK.\\n\"Higher education is a transformational experience and that is why we are the first government to remove the limit on student numbers lifting the cap on aspiration.\"\\nMore on This Story\\n11 SEPTEMBER 2014, EDUCATION & FAMILY\\nShare this page\\nThe battle for guns at university\\nMost Popular\\n', u'Thai tuna firm buys US rival Bumble Bee for $1.5bn\\nBumble Bee boasts annual sales of around $1bn\\nForced to fish on Thailand\\'s trawlers\\nThe world\\'s largest canned tuna producer Thai Union Frozen Products is buying US rival Bumble Bee Foods for $1.5bn (\\u014196m).\\nBumble Bee, the largest canned tuna and sardine producer in North America, is currently owned by private equity firm Lion Capital.\\nThe purchase is aimed at expanding Thai Union\\'s presence overseas and is expected to increase revenues by 25%.\\nThai Union said the deal was the biggest acquisition in its history.\\nIts chief executive, Thiraphong Chansiri, called the deal \"one of the most exciting external growth propositions\".\\n\"Bumble Bee Seafoods is a leading player in North American shelf-stable seafood; combining the business with Thai Union Group will lower costs, improve efficiency, and create the global leader in the shelf-stable seafood space,\" he said in a statement.\\nThe Thai firm, which owns the John West and Chicken of the Sea brands, has been on an acquisition spree in the past year.\\nEarlier this year, it announced that was buying Norwegian seafood firm King Oscar and French smoked salmon producer MerAlliance for undisclosed sums.\\nChris Lischewski, chief executive of Bumble Bee Seafoods said the two firms were \"a natural combination given the synergies that exist\".\\nBumble Bee boasts annual sales of around $1bn.\\nMore on This Story\\n23 JANUARY 2014, MAGAZINE\\nFrom other news sites\\n\\xa0\\n06:48: Gas prices BBC Radio 4\\nProfessor Green says energy suppliers have an eye on politics at the moment.

So, no, it wasn\\'t a great surprise in the end.\"\\nSebastian Vettel v Daniel Ricciardo\\nChampionship position\\n3\\n3\\nVettel has insisted he is \"not running away from anything\" at Red Bull and that he simply wanted a change of scenery and the chance to drive for Ferrari, where his childhood hero and later friend Michael Schumacher won five world titles.\\nVettel will be team-mate there to Kimi Raikkonen in 2015.\\nHorner said: \"The timing was right for Sebastian. He\\'d had a great run with us. He\\'d been with Red Bull since 12 years of age.\\n\"He\\'s won four world championships, 39 grands prix, 45 pole positions and I think he felt: \\'I\\'ve reached 27 years of age. I don\\'t want to end my career without having driven for Ferrari and I have a great opportunity to go there.\\'\\n\"The lure of Ferrari for any driver is immensely powerful.\"\\nVettel feels \\'ready for next step\\'\\nVettel finished fifth in the championship, with Ricciardo third, having been out-scored by 71 points. Ricciardo out-qualified his team-mate 12 times in 19 races.\\nHorner said Vettel struggled to adapt to the new cars in F1 this year following the introduction of V6 turbo hybrid engines, reductions in downforce and a fuel restriction.\\n\"He didn\\'t like what F1 had become and was quite vocal about it - didn\\'t like the engines, the noise, the way the car felt,\" Horner said.\\n\"He was pretty upset about that at the beginning but once he realised that was it - it wasn\\'t going to change - he started to get his head around it. He worked very hard, as he always has.\\n\"But he got very frustrated the car wasn\\'t doing what he wanted it to do and of course to compound that his team-mate is winning a couple of races and performing at the level he was.\"\\nRed Bull team principal Christian Horner said the new rules in F1 had affected Vettel\\'s driving style\\nHorner said the banning of exhaust-influenced rear aerodynamics, a technology in which Red Bull had excelled in the previous four seasons, had a big effect on Vettel.\\n\"The rule changes were significant and the two guys who seem to have been affected most are Seb and Kimi and I think taking away the rear downforce has actually been a big factor for Sebastian,\" Horner said.\\n\"How he generated his lap time was very much using the rear of the car on entry into the slower corners, which was much diminished this year, and that together with the brake-by-wire system had taken away some of the feeling of the braking that he is so dependent on.\\n\"He is such a \\'feel\\' driver that some of those feelings had been muted and it dumbed down some of his performance.\"\\nAlso related to this story\\n', u'Ennio Morricone: \\'I regret saying no to Clint Eastwood\\'\\nEnnio Morricone has received 56 awards for his musical scores\\nBjork wins Polar music accolade\\nRenowned Italian film composer Ennio Morricone said he regrets saying \"no\" to Clint Eastwood.\\nThe 86-year-old wrote the score to the 1960s trilogy of spaghetti Westerns by Sergio Leone, which saw Eastwood rise to fame.\\nBut Morricone said he turned down the chance to write for films Eastwood directed \"out of respect\" to Leone.\\n\"I missed a great opportunity and I am really sorry,\" he told the BBC\\'s arts editor Will Gompertz.\\nMorricone, or Maestro, as he is known in his hometown of Rome, added: \"When Clint called me, I said no out of respect to Sergio Leone, not because I did not like the movies that he did.\"\\nAlthough he had first met Sergio Leone when they were at school, it was not until 25 years later that their professional partnership began, on a Fistful of Dollars in 1964.\\n\"Gradually over time, he as a director and me as a composer, we improved and reached our best, in my opinion, in Once Upon A Time In America,\" the composer said.\\nEnnio Morricone was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2007 by Clint Eastwood\\nThey went on to work together on Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and Leone\\'s last credited western, A Fistful of Dynamite (1971).\\n\"After this relationship with Leone I was able to suggest to other directors how to respond to the music\\n\"Often directors ask me for pieces lasting 20 seconds and in 20 seconds people do not understand - it is music that is wasted,\" he added.\\nMorricone, who will resume his European tour next year, said that being a composer is a \"difficult profession\" and he gets worried by every film he works on.\\n\"There are ideas that crop up immediately but the majority arrive late.\\n\"There is no film that has not worried me.

And the obsessiveness does suggest that it was probably the work of George III around 1788 or 1789 when he was recovering from his illness.\"\\nThe handwriting also strongly resembles that of the monarch.\\nSecret documents\\nMr Clayton believes the plan was a study for the re-development of The White House at Kew, one of a string of royal residences around Richmond and Kew that were built during the 18th Century.\\nHe said contemporaries reported that the King spent a good deal of time \"drawing plans somewhat manically for rebuilding the house, while recovering from his first serious illness\".\\nThe architectural floor plan is part of the King\\'s Topographical Collection. He was a keen armchair traveller, fascinated by geography and a passionate collector.  He brought together more than 60,000 maps, views and watercolours from all over the world, particularly Great Britain and the British Empire.\\nThere are some of the earliest views of Canada, created on birch bark, and there are the first known watercolours of Sydney to be painted by a professional artist.\\nNigel Hawthorne portrayed George III on both screen and stage\\nIt also contains a map of New York that was presented to the Duke of York to celebrate the city\\'s capture by the English from the Dutch in 1664. It was, according to Peter Barber, \"the birth certificate of New York\".\\nThe collection also includes highly sensitive and secret government documents for English fortifications around the world, which Mr Barber says should not have been in the King\\'s possession.\\n\"Had they been discovered, England would have been in danger,\" he said.\\n\"They would be sent to him for approval, he would see something interesting and, I think, without asking anybody, he would simply keep them for himself.\"\\n', u'Media playback is unsupported on your device\\nPeshawar remembers school attack by Taliban\\n18 December 2014 Last updated at 19:26 GMT\\nPupils who survived a massacre at their school in Pakistan have been paying tribute to those who died.\\nAt least 132 children and nine staff were killed when Taliban gunmen stormed the building on Tuesday.\\nFergal Keane reports from Peshawar.\\nRead more\\nBBC \\u0160 2014 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

IS took control of Mosul in June, introducing a strict regime in line with its radical interpretation of Islamic law.\\nIn a series of diary entries, Mosul residents describe life under IS. Their names have been changed to protect their identities.\\n19 December 2014\\nFrom Mays\\nWith the mobile phone network still out of action, it was with extreme difficulty that my sister let me know that she was extremely sick.\\nThis has become another chore to add to the list\\x94\\nEnd Quote\\nI rushed to her house on the other side of one of the city\\'s bridges. Peering at the Euphrates, I said to my husband: \"Even this river is unclear! When will our situation clear up so that our water clears again?\"\\nEventually we reached my sister\\'s house, but she was in extreme pain. We rushed her to the city\\'s hospital, which was extremely overcrowded, with people with similar symptoms.\\nAs soon as we inquired, we were told there was an outbreak of poisoning across the city. The only common factor was the water.\\n\\'Harder and harder\\'\\nIt turned out my sister was suffering from water poisoning, mainly from the water that is pumped into the city from the eastern and western pumping stations.\\nWith water purifiers scarce, the stations had been pumping water into the houses through the pipes, without purification or filtration.\\nI saw one of our relatives in the hospital - they were also suffering from water poisoning. It dawned on me that the state of the water in the Euphrates that I saw crossing that bridge was the same as when it reached our homes.\\nThis was all followed by a sharp rise in the price of bottled water. One of two water bottling factories in the city is closed due to the owner\\'s absence, and the other is working with limited capacity - plus roads to Kurdistan, where you can buy bottled water, are all blocked.\\nAs we returned home I was agitated thinking about my sister and the whole situation. I know that IS does not care whether our water is filtered or not, so I found myself trying to filter our own water at home mainly by boiling it.\\nThis has become another chore to add to the list, as life under the Islamic State becomes harder and harder.\\n11 December 2014\\nFrom Mays\\nOur suffering due to the water shortage has turned into a state of fear that won\\'t go away.\\nMy husband goes on to the roof every day to see if the water tanks have been filled by the electrical pump from the main water supply.\\nWe kept hearing explosions for over three hours\\x94\\nEnd Quote\\nOn one unforgettably terrifying night, I decided to go on to the roof with my husband to help him.\\nWe suddenly heard a loud explosion followed by loud voices from the nearby street.\\nWe quietly and carefully shifted to peer at the road where we heard the explosion and the voices.\\nWe saw a group of Islamic State fighters shooting in the air, and I feared for my husband because they were banging on doors searching for men in the area in order to question them.\\nTrembling with fear\\nIt turned out that the explosion was caused by a bomb planted on one of the IS vehicles.\\nWithin a few seconds the terrifying sound of fighter jets filled the sky, and they starting bombing IS fighters.\\nIS vehicles were full of ammunition and we kept hearing explosions for over three hours.\\nI was trembling with fear for my husband and my children and dreading the sound of the doorbell. But thankfully the aerial bombardment caused a great deal of confusion among IS fighters, and they didn\\'t knock on our door.\\nWhen the sun rose we managed to see the extent of the damage to the houses and the street caused by the bombing.\\nWe decided to leave our house and stay at a relative\\'s place for a few days because I was afraid for my family.\\n5 December 2014\\nFrom Nizar\\nWe have been shocked by the outage of the Asiacell mobile phone network, the main provider in the city. It has left me in a terrible state because, like everyone else, my business depends on communication. In fact, everyone in Mosul depends on it for that matter.\\nPeople gather on a hill in Mosul to try to get a mobile phone signal\\nA few hours after the network went down, others such as Korek, Zain and Fanous followed.\\nIt\\'s left the city in a complete void, like we\\'ve gone back to the dark ages.\\nWe have to rely on people around us and local internet providers for communication.\\n\\'Not knowing\\'\\nEverybody was confused by what happened and we were all asking each other, trying to find out when the service would be back. Some blamed the blackout on the government in Baghdad and others on Islamic State - either way, the city is lost.\\nThe worst part is there is no real alternative, so if you need to speak to someone you\\'d have to go to find them at their home or workplace, assuming they were there in the first place.\\nThat happened to me as I was trying to locate a merchant I do business with, who in turn was looking for another person to settle some financial accounts, and I waited and waited, but without success.\\nI then returned home to take my sick father to the doctor\\'s clinic, also not knowing whether the doctor would be there or not. I was, however, lucky and managed to sort out my family and work affairs - albeit with great difficulty.\\nWe don\\'t know how long this will last or whether we should start getting used to it as a way of life.\\nFrom Faisal\\nMy mother called me asking me whether I could buy her a gas canister to replace the one at home as it had run out.\\nI took the empty canister and drove to a shop downtown, only to discover that the price for a replacement was more than 60 Iraqi dinars ($50).\\nHow can we continue living under this caliphate\\x94\\nEnd Quote\\nI was in complete shock. Before IS took control, the price was barely $7, but with IS it just kept on rising.\\nI came back home thinking how would I ever be able to afford it given our tight financial situation. After debating with my mother, we decided it was better if I went back and bought one anyway as life at our home depends on such a necessary item, for cooking, for example.\\nForced to shut\\nI went back the next morning to discover that its price had gone up to $100 - and there were no canisters for sale in sight!\\nI rushed back home in a panic, but decided I\\'d better buy some lunch from a restaurant on the way because we didn\\'t have fuel to cook.\\nThe restaurant was shut. When I asked why, I was told the owner couldn\\'t afford the ever-increasing cost of new gas canisters - so he had to shut the whole place down!\\nThirteen restaurant employees were laid off - that\\'s 13 families who can no longer earn bread, all because of the price of a gas canister. In fact, most restaurants have had to shut, apart from a few which have a stock of gas.\\nOthers have resorted to burning wood, using very expensive electric heaters, or stoves that run on oil.\\nWe are tired of this situation - there is no clean water, fuel or gas to cook our food.\\nHow can we continue living under this caliphate?\\nMosul profile\\nHow can I use this new currency which is only recognised in IS territory?! \\x94\\nEnd Quote\\nHe said that a group of pious and highly religious men from IS had decided to mint a new gold coin and new coins made of silver and copper in addition to new paper notes which will be used in the markets in the near future.\\nHe also said that another group of pious IS youth organised an advertising campaign to announce the use of the new currency.\\nThe aim was to make the new Islamic dinar a force to be reckoned with against the US dollar used by the infidels, as the imam said, in what turned out to be the same sermon forced by IS on all the mosques.\\nPanic-selling\\nI went home feeling worried and confused. I have business and bank accounts and bank dealings with other countries. How can I use this new currency which is only recognised in IS territory?!\\nThe IS dinar was going to replace the official Iraqi currency and use of the dollar was going to be banned. I didn\\'t know what to do, and I sat with a group of friends to discuss what would happen to our money and to our business.\\nEverybody agreed they would exchange the existing Iraqi currency for US dollars or for gold jewellery.\\nWe all agreed that the IS plan was not religious or ideological as they said, but merely a scheme to rob us of our money and savings.\\nThe next morning a state of chaos gripped the market as everybody was trying to get rid of the Iraqi dinar and to buy dollars or gold.\\n21 November 2014\\nFrom Faisal\\nOnce upon a time in our land, which is rich with water and oil, we used to have a big supply of water and electricity. However, now in the time of the IS caliphate, we lead the most difficult life imaginable.\\nWe don\\'t have water because the supply station does not work most of the time due to a power shortage.\\nWe dug a well to find enough water for our needs\\x94\\nEnd Quote\\nWe collect rainwater in the garden, and my mum tries to save the rain falling on the roof through the gutter in order to use it for the laundry and cleaning.\\nWinter came early, and the cold is really harsh. Hot water is one of the most basic requirements of winter in Iraq, but how can we have hot water? We haven\\'t had any electricity supply from our national provider for a month or more!\\nWe totally rely on private generators. Life would have been impossible in my beloved city without them.\\nMy neighbours tried to find a solution to the water shortage, so we dug a well to find enough water for our needs during the continuous shortage of water supply.\\nDigging water wells became very prevalent in Mosul, and everybody is digging for water in my country that boasts two major rivers.\\nWe now try to save kerosene for heating, although it\\'s very scarce and expensive.  The price of a barrel is about $250, although its price on the international markets is no more than $100.\\nBut this is not surprising because we live in Iraq, the land of miracles.\\n14 November 2014\\nThey completely banned the use of colours and coloured pens in school\\x94\\nEnd Quote\\nHe is Egyptian, and his main focus was separating girls from boys in primary schools. According to his instructions, girls go to one building and boys to another. He gave his instructions that girls who look a bit mature for their age should wear loose-fitting garments and a face veil.\\nMale teachers are not allowed to teach girls and women teachers are not allowed to teach boys. This decision is very difficult to be implemented by public schools and more so for the private ones.\\nPublic schools are funded by the education authority and the ministry of education, and they have a large supply of teachers - male and female - and a lot of buildings.\\nPrivate schools, on the other hand, are educational and commercial projects owned by private individuals who do not have the resources to supply the teachers and the buildings.\\nThis means that the demand for private schools will decrease in a time when job opportunities are very scarce and money is hard to come by.\\n\\'They cancelled art\\'\\nSchool syllabuses have been changes by IS. There are no physical education classes anymore. Instead there is \"jihadi education\", which is a subject in which students are taught to love jihad [an Islamic concept meaning \"struggle\"] and how to do so.\\nIS cancelled both geography and history lessons, but then they changed their mind. They cancelled art classes, and instead teach Arabic calligraphy. They completely banned the use of colours and coloured pens in schools.\\nAll these matter make the running of schools very difficult, even impossible, especially banning students from activities, such as sports and painting, that mean the world to them.\\n5 November 2014\\nFrom Nizar\\n[Editor\\'s note: Before Islamic State overran Mosul, the city was home to one of the oldest Christian communities in the world. Most fled with the arrival of IS, who ordered the city\\'s remaining Christians to convert to Islam, pay a religious tax, or face being killed.]\\nNot one house owned by a Christian in Mosul was not taken over and looted by IS members, and all their belongings stolen, down to the last broomstick.\\nI cannot bear to look at their evil faces\\x94\\nEnd Quote\\nSome IS fighters have even moved into the Christians\\' homes themselves, using everything in those houses as if they were their own.\\nThey\\'ve inhabited all the areas and consider them as spoils of war, as if the Christians and the Yazidis [minority religious group] were the enemy, and by doing so, the IS has become a burden on our areas.\\nWe feel ashamed to call our Christian and Yazidi friends, and I feel I cannot even phone them any more, as if it was me or one of my family or friends that committed those heinous crimes against them.\\nI decided not to talk or salute any IS member who occupies a Christian house near me, and I cannot bear to look at their evil faces.\\nFleeing air strikes\\nI\\'ve taken notice of their behaviour during coalition air strikes. They immediately switch off the lights in the homes they occupy, and some drive off in their stolen cars in some unknown direction.\\nThen they return as soon as the air strikes cease. A friend of mine had the nerve to ask one of them: \"Why do you run away during the air strikes?\"\\nThe IS member answered that they fear the strikes will target the houses of Christians that they\\'ve occupied because the Christians would have told the coalition their location.\\nAnother friend of mine tried to get close to a house occupied by an IS member and his family to see what was happening there, but he was unable to as they never leave the door open, and don\\'t even talk in the garden.\\nMy friends and I vowed that once this is over, and our city is cleared of the dirt and nastiness, that we would rehabilitate a Christian house to show the world, or at least our Christian friends, that those who did this to them abide by no religion at all.\\n24 October 2014\\nFrom Faisal\\nFour months have passed since Islamic State took over, and a friend of mine is still in hiding here.\\nHe worked as a bodyguard for some judges in Mosul, but after the city fell all the judges left and my friend went into hiding. He moved home so no-one would know where to find him.\\nTheir criminal acts have terrorised peaceful citizens\\x94\\nEnd Quote\\nMy friend doesn\\'t move around in the streets much, because IS fighters are almost everywhere in the city.\\nSometimes they set up impromptu checkpoints and go through people\\'s IDs, looking for people wanted by IS: former security personnel or judiciary, or anyone suspected of arresting IS members before IS captured the city, or anyone who worked for the governorate or in politics.\\nMost of them have left, fearing execution by IS. These kinds of actions have pushed people away from supporting IS. Their criminal acts have terrorised peaceful citizens.\\nIS members can be seen executing activists in front of everyone in the streets. They wear black fighter outfits, have let their hair and beards grow - some look as if they haven\\'t seen a shower in ages!\\nEvery day they increase in number, hold new positions and consolidate their presence, undeterred by the air strikes from coalition forces which do nothing to change things on the ground. It it is actually our reality which has changed and become even more horrific.\\nFrom Mays\\nI teach at a school in my beloved  city, Mosul. Like other Iraqi mothers I work to provide some sort of financial assistance to my husband, albeit negligible, to help fend off the hardships of life through such hard times and in such an expensive country.\\nThis year, when the summer holidays began, I decided to go to Baghdad to visit some family and relatives there and attend a family ceremony.\\nAfter the party, when we were all still full of excitement and surrounded by our loved ones, I received news of a curfew back home, and the start of the fighting between government forces and Islamic State rebels.\\nFrom that moment I spoke to my husband in Mosul every day to find out the latest news.\\n\\'Horror and panic\\'\\nI spent the worst days of my life in Baghdad, the city of my childhood innocence, and where I lived my dreams as a woman in my 20s. I had always been thrilled to live in Baghdad until I got married and moved to Mosul.\\nThose were moments I will never forget\\x94\\nEnd Quote\\nAnd yet, for five days of fighting which followed in Mosul, I lived in horror, fear and pure panic, worrying about my husband. I was constantly wondering what was happening and whether I would ever be with him again.\\nAfter the arrival of the Sunni rebels and IS fighters in Mosul, my husband and I started plotting my return to the city, but all roads were still blocked because of the fighting taking place between Baghdad and Mosul.\\nCities were falling in hours - not even days - after governmental forces fled or retreated, which left everybody puzzled.\\nAfter several attempts by my husband and thanks to some of his connections, we managed to book flights from Baghdad to the north.\\nBut then another obstacle faced us - I had not brought my children\\'s documentation as I was travelling by land. Yet as we were now flying, it was a must, or we wouldn\\'t be able to leave.\\nArmed groups\\nThanks to good thinking and God\\'s will we received the documents via a friend who was leaving Mosul by car and who later flew to Baghdad and brought us the papers.\\nI finally got home to my family in Mosul, shortly after midnight on 20 June. I was shocked and frightened by what I saw in the streets, where armed groups were roaming around. I prayed and fasted for three days.\\nI stayed at home for a while, until I got used to the situation we are now living under, but those were moments I will never forget.\\nMore on This Story\\n', u'Letter from Africa: The culture of sharing the cake\\n\\xa0\\nJoseph Warungu: Gagging order?\\nIn our series of letters from African journalists, Nigerian writer and novelist Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at the clamour for assistance that accompanies a politician\\'s rise to office.\\nThe political party primaries in Nigeria have drawn to a close and voters now have a clearer picture of whose turn it might be to divide up the national cake after the elections in February 2015.\\nBut the winning candidates won\\'t be the only ones taking their share of the country\\'s riches.\\nIn Nigeria, news of a person\\'s success in an election often travels at the speed of lightning, over rivers and mountains and past fields and forests, to his kindred in all corners of the globe.\\nThose with no jobs believe their days of unemployment are coming to an end; those with no education think it will soon pose no barrier to climbing the corporate ladder; those in faraway lands begin plans to return home.\\nSoon, these kith and kin launch their pilgrimage towards the successful candidate.\\nThey ring his phone; they send text messages; they knock at his gate.\\nThey offer to help his campaign in any way they can; they organise prayer sessions for his victory, usually late at night in his living room.\\n\\x93Start Quote\\nThe most unforgivable sin a politician can commit is to forget \\'his people\\' after he assumes office\\x94\\nEnd Quote Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani\\n\\'Bitter tongues will wag\\'\\nA friend of mine who lives in Lagos told me last week that he was travelling to Benin state.\\nHis friend had just \"picked up\" a spot in the House of Assembly there.

In more than half of the country, it\\'s up to the universities themselves to decide weapons policy. In New Hampshire, where Dartmouth is located, the decision is left to the college, which chose to keep its campus gun free.\\nMany institutions believe that allowing weapons on campus has the potential to inflame tense situations, rather than diffuse them.\\nThe American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) has stated, \"Even with the best of intentions, armed students or employees could escalate an already explosive situation further, accidentally cause harm or use a gun in a situation that is not warranted.\"\\nThis month however, a Florida legislator brought forth a bill calling to allow students to carry guns on campus. He cited a recent campus shooting at Florida State University as a reason students need firearms.\\nA national group, Students For Concealed Carry, is also calling for the right for students to have a concealed weapon. It would mean they could have a gun in their bag at university, but wouldn\\'t be able display it on a holster.\\nCrayle Vanest is Midwest regional director for the group. A student at Indiana University, she got her first rifle at the age of 14 for sport, before getting her concealed carry permit.\\n\"As soon as you walk into the doors of a university you should still be able to carry your gun if you have a licence,\" she says.\\n\"Your rights shouldn\\'t change once you step inside the campus.\"\\nVanest says her organisation has attracted many women.\\nLike the vast number of colleges and universities across the US, Dartmouth prohibits handguns on campus.\\n\"We want to protect ourselves on campus which is an area where women are very frequently victimised.\"\\nBut just as there are groups advocating for students to carry guns, there are many who call for the opposite, arguing that the presence of weapons exacerbates violence on campus.\\n\"Having access to guns only increases the chances of an innocent person being hit, versus actually hitting a target or a person who\\'s trying to stalk you,\" argues Jamira Burley, a member of the Generation Progress, Gun Violence Network.\\nBurley also cites the high levels of suicide among college students as another reason for guns to be banned from places of education. She says 85% of suicide attempts using guns are fatal, compared with only 2% who attempt a drug overdose.\\nFor Taylor, the right to bear arms isn\\'t about exercising a constitutional right, it\\'s about staying safe.\\n\"What else am I supposed to do? What other option is there? I\\'ve tried everything, I\\'ve obeyed all the laws,\" she says. ,\"I\\'ve never responded to a single message, I\\'ve stayed away, I\\'ve gone to school 35,000 miles away from my home town, my parents have sold their home and moved,\" she says.\\n\"There\\'s no other option.\"\\nA city government in China has been using security guards to pose as police officers.\\nRelated Stories\\nResidents of IS-run Mosul sick from drinking the river\\nMost Popular\\n', u\"Print\\nHow are Venezuelans coping with tumbling oil prices?\\nThe Venezuelan government will have to do some blue sky thinking to get the economy back on track\\nVenezuela's inflation rises to 63.4%\\nFalling global oil prices have been a headache for many oil-producing countries, with exports now failing to bring in cash they used to just six months ago.\\nOn Thursday, the price of Brent crude was just below $63 a barrel, while US crude was near $58.\\nThe price of Venezuelan oil, which is very heavy by international standards, was even lower - at $57.53 a barrel for the week ending 13 December.\\nThe dramatic downward slide started in June.\\nSix months of falling prices have hit Venezuela particularly hard - the country is heavily dependent on oil money, with 96% of export revenues coming from oil, according to reports .\\nBBC News has been speaking to a selection of Venezuelans on the streets of Caracas to find out how they have been personally affected by the fall in oil prices.\\nOil down, goods up\\nAlex Hernandez, a businessman in Caracas, says the problem is exacerbated by a lack of foreign currency.\\nBusinessman Alex Hernandez says the fall in oil prices means there is not enough foreign currency to import goods\\nIn 2003, the Venezuelan government set a fixed rate for foreign currency exchange.\\nThe move was designed to keep government control over prices and to make certain basic items, such as bread and rice, more affordable to the poor.\\nUnder the currency controls, people and businesses can receive US dollars at the official rate only by applying to a government currency agency, and then only for the purpose of importing goods or to pay for foreign travel.\\nMr Hernandez believes the fall in oil prices has made it even harder for businessmen like himself to get hold of the foreign currency needed to buy the imported goods he sells.\\nA falling oil price means fewer dollars flowing into Venezuela's government coffers, and less to spend on paying for imports.\\nAs Mr Hernandez mentioned, prices for goods in Venezuela have been rising\\nThe most recent official figures put the inflation rate at 63.4% .\\nThe figures were the first Venezuela's central bank had released since May, which led critics to accuse the government of withholding data for political reasons.\\nNeither did the central bank publish its scarcity index, a measure of goods that are missing from store shelves, but it is clear the difficulty of getting hold of basic products is a source of discontent for many.\\nDaily hunt\\nHousewife Eugenia Martinez says she sometimes has to queue all day to get what she needs for her family.

But in the Hungarian capital Budapest, \"escape room games\" are luring in tourists and locals alike. So what\\'s the appeal?\\nIf I\\'m honest I can\\'t make head nor tail of the drawing in front of me. It looks like a plumbing diagram.\\nAnd while it\\'s clear that the sequence of noises - a church bell ringing, a frog croaking, a cat mewling - are code for something, I am none the wiser.\\nI\\'m in a dimly lit cellar, furnished with creaking chairs, broken toys, and old computer monitors. The low-arched brick ceilings have been whitewashed, but there are few other concessions to civilisation.\\nPeeling paint and low lighting add to the atmosphere\\nBut sometimes it\\'s hard to tell what is a clue and what is just part of the sinister decor\\nContinue reading the main story\\n\\x93Start Quote\\nThere is a theory that because we were closed off from the rest of the world we turned towards games\\x94\\nEnd Quote Zoltan Kovacs Founder of Trap\\nWith time pressure mounting it\\'s vital that my team and I piece together some kind of logic among the junk, if we want to make an escape. That\\'s the challenge. Identify each puzzle in the room, unravel its mystery in turn and you may get out before your allotted hour is up.\\nBut still ringing in my ears are the words of owner Attila Gyurkovics before he locked us in: \"Getting out is not guaranteed.\"\\nHidden objects\\nParapark was Budapest\\'s first escape room game, based on the timeless truth that everyone relishes a challenge.\\nFor just over 8,000 forints (\\u014120) a team of up to five people has 60 minutes of complete distraction from the real world above. And despite Attila\\'s ominous tone there is no real price to pay, except frustration, if he has to unlock the door for you in the end.\\nAfter wrestling with puzzle pieces, a broken doll and intermittent blackouts we\\'re eventually free and Attila, a former social worker, tells me how the idea for Parapark occurred to him just over three years ago.\\nAttila Gyurkovics came up with the escape game three years ago\\n\"I was playing computer games - hidden object games - with my girlfriend,\" he says.\\nHe noticed how absorbing they were, how despite their artifice, he was so swept along he stopped noticing the time passing.\\n\"After a while I thought, \\'That\\'s what we have to do in real life.\\'\"\\nFaded grandeur\\nSince Parapark opened its doors in 2011, Hungarians have taken the concept and run with it.\\nIn Budapest it is estimated there are now about 60 different escape games.\\nThe themes are pleasingly varied, including joining Alice down the rabbit hole, racing to defuse a suitcase bomb and being trapped in a psychiatric ward.\\nThere\\'s one obvious reason why Budapest is the crucible for this burst of creativity.\\nMany Budapest properties are in need of renovation\\nThe streets are lined with majestic Habsburg era townhouses. But their grandeur is fading. Chunks of plaster lie in the gutters and broken windows indicate empty properties, even in the city centre.\\nThe financial crisis knocked the wind out of Hungary\\'s property market and you can rent an apartment for just a few hundred dollars a month. A cellar costs even less.\\nTomb raiders\\n\"The truth is conditions are ideal here for this game, as if these cellars were made for this,\" admits Zoltan Kovacs, who runs Trap, another escape game company in Budapest.\\n\"The premises are so cheap. It\\'s easy to get a permit. Everything is suitable for making easy money. It\\'s tempting to try it.\"\\nIn some ways it\\'s too tempting. The main worry for established businesses like Zoltan\\'s is the explosion of new games, some of which have been thrown together quickly and cheaply to cash in on the craze.\\nTrap\\'s games are more elaborate than most. The props and puzzles are purpose built from glass, wood and metal, while a sophisticated network of electronic triggers opens up secret passages and new challenges. It takes his team six months and around \\u01418,000 to develop a new game.\\nZoltan Kovacs is taking the idea of exit games into businesses and schools\\nAs we\\'re talking a team of foreign students arrives.\\nOne room here is furnished like a medieval castle complete with gallows, an axe and a treasure chest.\\nBut the group is eager to pit their wits in the other game: the ancient Egyptian tomb.\\nPuzzle masters\\nSo just how smart do you have to be to solve the puzzles? Zoltan claims no specialist knowledge is required beyond secondary school level.\\nHe left school as soon as he could and says if he can solve a puzzle it\\'s not too difficult.\\nBut he did pass his leaving exam, and it\\'s worth noting that Hungary\\'s traditional education system expects students to be proficient in geography, physics and arithmetic.\\nMoreover Hungary is famous for producing both world-class chess players, and a high number of Nobel Prize winners in maths and science. Houdini was born in Hungary.\\nIs it possible that Hungarians have a special affinity for these kinds of brainteasers?\\n\"Under communism we were forced to be creative and resourceful,\" says Zoltan.\\n\"There is a theory that because we were closed off from the rest of the world we turned towards games. This is why Erno Rubik invented his cube. We had nothing else left.\"\\nNo specialist knowledge required, just a logical mind\\nTeamwork is key\\nBut that doesn\\'t prevent moments of individual frustration\\n\\'Like reality\\'\\nThe rest of the world is taking to Hungary\\'s games now too.\\nCopies have begun to spring up in other European cities, almost all offshoots or franchises of Hungarian ones.\\nTrap is expanding to offer corporate team-building, a mobile game, and versions to use in schools. Zoltan\\'s eyes light up as he describes his idea for a game based on 19th Century inventors such as James Watt and Thomas Edison.\\nFinally the team of students appears through the exit. They have done rather well, locating secret panels, deciphering hieroglyphs and confronting mummified heads.\\nAnd despite the effort, they\\'ve enjoyed the experience.\\n\"It\\'s really realistic. That\\'s what makes it special,\" says Manuel from Germany.\\n\"You\\'re really trapped in a room... sometimes when you\\'re into it, it doesn\\'t feel like a game. It feels like reality somehow.\"\\n\"You have to try it - because it\\'s Budapest,\" says his French teammate Francois. He shrugs. \"Just try it.\"\\nMore on This Story\\n', u\"Viewpoint: Obama secures legacy with Cuba policy shift\\nBy Michael Shifter President of Inter-American Dialogue\\nThe policy changes lift restrictions on Cuba in place for more than five decades\\nAmerica's man in Havana\\nWith the speech outlining a major shift in US-Cuban relations, President Barack Obama secured his legacy in Latin America.\\nThis was the speech most Latin Americans were hoping to hear from a US president for decades - and one many believed they would hear shortly after Obama came to office in 2009.\\nIt took a lame duck session, a president unburdened by concerns about Florida politics, and a worsening economic situation in Cuba to produce the long-awaited change.\\nTo be sure, Obama had already moved in 2009 to lift the restrictions on travel and remittances of Cuban Americans that had been imposed by the George W Bush administration in 2004.\\nAlthough those measures were welcome and had some effect, they were mainly on the margins and did not represent any fundamental shift towards engagement.\\nBut on Wednesday Obama sounded a lot like the advocates for policy change on Cuba.\\nUS President Barack Obama announced sweeping changes to US-Cuba policy on Wednesday\\nHe did not just call for punishing Cuba less than before, but rather to end efforts to isolate Cuba diplomatically and squeeze it economically.\\nObama made it clear that he is now committed to reversing course and opening up with Cuba in a meaningful way. That means pursuing expanded trade, communication and cooperation.\\nAlthough he still has to work within the legislatively mandated embargo, Obama has ample latitude and can build political momentum towards ending the anachronistic policy.\\nTo realise the full potential of the new measures will, however, require some changes in Havana as well.\\nIf the new US-Cuba policies will get the political backing in Washington they need to be sustained and succeed, there will have to be some indication that Cuba is taking steps towards greater political opening.\\nA look back at the relationship between the two countries through the decades\\nIf the regime cracks down, hardliners in the US Congress will have more ammunition to push back.\\nThe new measures will test the long-held view that the Cuban leadership actually wants and needs the punitive US embargo to justify its absolute political control.\\nRemoving that gift to the regime, the argument goes, will undercut its legitimacy and open things up.\\nWhile that view may well have been largely plausible when Fidel Castro was in charge, it is less persuasive in the current moment and under his younger brother Raul\\xb4s direction.\\nRaul Castro has presided over a series of measures of economic opening, including reduction of state employment and the spread of private businesses, but these have moved slowly and have had a number of difficulties, frustrating many Cubans.\\nVenezuelan President Hugo Chavez has supported Cuba financially\\nAlthough one can never be certain, having been in Havana over the last week there is a sense that, out of sheer economic necessity, the Raul Castro government would like to see more open and productive economic relations with the United States.\\nThe Cuban economy is in dire straits and requires infusions of capital that will be hard to attain without significant US engagement.\\nCuba's already severe problems have recently been aggravated by Venezuela's unrelenting economic crisis, made much worse by falling oil prices. Cuba has been heavily dependent on Venezuelan largess since Hugo Chavez came to power in 1999.\\nIt is unclear, of course, whether the Obama administration's new measures will contribute to greater political opening and improvements in human rights in Cuba.\\nBut few can argue seriously that the punitive approach, in place for over half a century, helped much on that score. Obama the empiricist believes that if a policy doesn't work it is time to try something else.\\nNo policy, foreign or domestic, better fits that dictum. Also judging by the reaction on the streets of Havana, most Cubans too are relieved that the US-Cuba deadlock is over and could - though not easily or quickly - unleash some positive changes in their country.\\nWashington's absurd Cuba policy has long stood in the way of a more constructive relationship with Latin America.  No issue has been such a powerful unifying factor across the region.\\nCuban President Raul Castro discussed the sweeping changes to US policy with Mr Obama prior to their announcement\\nThis bold move will not eliminate the growing distance between the United States and Latin America, but it is likely to help reduce the distance and open up opportunities for deeper engagement on a range of other issues.\\nWhen Obama attends the Summit of the Americas in Panama next April, and meets with his counterparts including Raul Castro, he is expected to be greeted with great warmth and enthusiasm.\\nObama may discover that, as he looks across the global geopolitical landscape, with religious wars flaring, he may have more time for Latin America in his remaining two years in office.\\nMore on This Story\\nThe battle for guns at university\\nMost Popular\\n\", u'Putin\\'s news conference: Five things we learned\\nBy Bridget Kendall Diplomatic correspondent, BBC News\\nPresident Putin reassured Russians that they would weather the difficulties\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has been speaking at his end-of-year news conference.\\nOver the course of three hours, he discussed the economy, Ukraine, the opposition - and his love life.\\nHere are five things we learnt.\\nBelt-tightening ahead\\nRussians are paying more for imported goods because of the plunging rouble\\nJudging by Mr Putin\\'s forecast, Russians can expect the current rocky ride to continue: the collapse in oil prices and plummeting rouble are due to \"external factors\" which may go on for two years.\\nBut the vulnerable will be looked after: food prices and pensions will be protected. And big spending plans to upgrade Russia\\'s armed forces, invest in infrastructure and prepare for the 2018 World Cup in Russia will be shaved, not shelved.\\nAnyway, if a cheaper rouble means more expensive imports that is to be welcomed, in Mr Putin\\'s view. He believes the only way Russia can grow stronger and safer is to rely less on foreigners and more on itself.\\n\"Only a strong Russian state can protect the interests of Russian citizens,\" he said, after telling a cautionary tale of an offshore Russian company whose money was blocked because of Western sanctions.\\nFor jittery markets, there were two concrete takeaways. First, a reassurance that it would not be right to take the drastic step of imposing planning capital controls - at least not yet.\\nSecond, the news that a prominent Russian oligarch has been released from house arrest and may even be granted a presidential audience.\\nVladimir Yevtushenkov\\'s arrest on charges of alleged money laundering a few months ago sent shivers through Russia\\'s business elite, who feared it might be a harbinger of more to come.\\nThe threat from without: Bear-baiting\\nAs usual, Mr Putin appeared to extend some olive branches, claiming he wanted to work with the West on issues of mutual concern, and insisting Russia stood ready to mediate in the Ukraine crisis.\\nBut elsewhere there was no spirit of compromise or conciliation, or any sign of the radical change in Russia\\'s outlook which the EU foreign policy chief has just appealed for.\\nOn Ukraine: \"We are right and you are wrong,\" he said, accusing the West of backing an illegal coup and explaining away the conflict in the south-east as Kiev\\'s \"punitive\" onslaught on its own citizens.\\nPresident Putin says the West is once again trying to rein in the Russian bear\\nAnd Russia\\'s involvement? Yes, there were some volunteer soldiers, but they were \"not mercenaries - they aren\\'t being paid\". Also, any trucks contained humanitarian aid.\\nMore importantly, in the last two months Mr Putin and his top officials have begun to argue that this crisis is not really about Crimea and Ukraine at all. Really, he now says, this is an age-old campaign by hostile Western powers intent on weakening and containing a Russian foe.\\nAny new \"walls\" being erected in Europe are due to Nato\\'s expansion, not Russian aggression. The West, he claims, has always wanted to \"chain the bear\" and \"defang it and pull out its claws\".\\nHe even insinuated that Russia\\'s war with Chechnya in the 1990s may have been partly fuelled - on the Chechen side - by outside help from the West.\\nThe threat from within: Invisible traitors\\nAs for Russia\\'s internal politics, he was twice asked where he drew the line between  a \"fifth column\" of traitors whom he says he will not tolerate, and a legitimate political opposition.\\nMr Putin repeatedly said it was a delicate matter and a difficult line to draw - hardly reassuring for those worried about where they stand.\\nHe added that it came down to what his critics thought. Were they Russian patriots who held their country dear, or were they acting on the orders of another government whose interests were alien to Russia\\'s?\\nHe doesn\\'t know what he earns\\nThe Kremlin is well-defended, says Mr Putin\\nSome of the Russian questions were surprisingly sharp and challenging:\\nWas the economic pain Russia was enduring now the cost it had to bear for taking Crimea?\\nDid Mr Putin know that some in his entourage privately blamed him for Russia\\'s problems, so was he afraid of a palace coup? The answer: \"No, because we have no palaces and the Kremlin is well defended.\"\\nAnd was it not his own cronies, those who reaped high salaries from controlling state enterprises or the main TV channels who were really the enemies of Russia?\\nMr Putin calmly replied that Igor Sechin, who runs Russia\\'s biggest state oil company, was an efficient manager and he had no idea what he earned. As an afterthought the Russian President added that he did not know what his own salary was either.\\nAs usual at this annual extravanganza, many regional journalists waved placards, like peasants petitioning their tsar. One woman, from a car magazine, brought along a green woolly crocodile to make her point.\\nAnother man, with slurred speech, called for Russians to drink less foreign Coca-Cola and more domestic kvas, a Russian honey drink. Mr Putin agreed with him, and joked that the questioner had already had enough - though it later emerged he was not drunk but had suffered from a stroke.\\nPutin and love\\nProbably the Russian public will best remember the woman from Voronezh who said her aunt wanted to know if he, Russia\\'s top bachelor, was still single. Mr Putin\\'s reply: \"Say hi to your aunt and tell her all is well.\"\\nHe added that he had told another friend that he was no monster but loved someone and was loved in return - and maintained good relations with his ex-wife.\\nMr Putin knows how to please the crowds. He throws in a few personal details to signal that he is as human as anyone else, and - even at this time of crisis - he is relaxed enough to enjoy banter with the audience in between the reassurances that Russia will weather its difficulties.\\nMore on This Story\\nThe battle for guns at university\\nMost Popular\\n', u'Luxembourg speaks for the Dutch\\nBy Laurence Peter BBC News\\nXavier Bettel says he is now satisfied that Luxembourg is not being unfairly targeted over tax\\nJuncker denies tax break allegations\\nIt\\'s not often that a country of half a million gets to represent a nation of 16 million.\\nLuxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel pointed that out light-heartedly, as he stood in for the Netherlands at an EU summit in Brussels.\\nHis Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte is embroiled in a coalition dispute over healthcare legislation.\\nSo Mr Bettel came here not long after Mr Rutte had phoned him to make the request.\\nIt is all the more surprising because Luxembourg is in the EU spotlight over its controversial tax sweeteners for huge corporations like Amazon and Microsoft.\\nWhy was Luxembourg chosen, rather than Belgium, to represent the Netherlands?\\n\"Because I\\'m older [than the Belgian PM] and I\\'ve been in the European Council longer,\" Mr Bettel told journalists.\\n\"For me it\\'s a question of trust - you know how closely in the Benelux we work together.\"\\nDutch PM Mark Rutte faces trouble at home over healthcare reform\\nInevitably the hot topic of tax arrangements came up.\\nHe said Luxembourg had dropped its appeals to the European Court of Justice over a European Commission request for information on Luxembourg tax rulings and the Grand Duchy\\'s patent box scheme, which deals with intellectual property taxes.\\nThe Commission had initiated an infringement procedure against Luxembourg.\\nBut Mr Bettel said he was now satisfied that Luxembourg was not being singled out, because soon all 28 EU states would have to divulge tax information to the Commission.\\n\"We always said fishing [for information] was not the right way to work - we insisted on a level playing field, so the rules are the same for everyone.\"\\nSo Luxembourg defused the court dispute.

These will bring the battery-operated vehicles under the act and fresh applicants can straightaway get learners\\' licence to drive such vehicles carrying four passengers.\\nThe bill was passed amid several questions raised by some of the members about the passenger safety aspects of these vehicles and poor quality parts imported from China.\\nThough several opposition MPs claimed that the amendments were brought only because of the upcoming Delhi assembly election, road transport minister rejected the contention saying delaying the changes would harm over 2 lakh poor whose livelihood is dependent on these vehicles. He added no safety issue has been compromised.\\nNow, the bill will be introduced in the Rajya Sabha for passage where again there is little chance that it would be blocked by any political party. If even then a stalemate arises in the Upper House, the government can bring an ordinance since it has already been passed by Lok Sabha, sources said.\\nGadkari said, \"This is an amendment bill. If we pass the bill, I will incorporate rules and regulations suggested by you,\" in response to members who demanded that the bill be sent to standing committee for a closer scrutiny. He added that early passage of the bill will be a boon for one crore underprivileged people who face a lot of health problems by plying cycle rickshaws manually.\\nSeveral members raised safety concerns and the danger posed by substandard vehicle parts from China. Congress MP Ranjeet Ranjan was more forthcoming when she said that she had her children rode an e-rickshaw. \"How many of us have travelled in an e-rickshaw. I took and so my children. But I decided never to use them....This vehicle can overturn if it hits a one feet stone or at a pothole. It\\'s very risky,\" she said.\\nWhile welcoming the \"smart e-rickshaws\" TDP member Ram Mohan Naidu said though the amendments are being made keeping in mind the one lakh e-rickshaw owners, \"But we have to see that with the one lakh e-rickshaws, there will be at least four people traveling in that. We should also consider the safety of these four lakh people and the safety of the people who are on the roads, when they are put on the road. How much are we compromising on safety?\"\\nHe added the new licencing regime will make it easier for drivers but the key question is how much safety standards is being compromised. \"Holding a drivers licence is not just learning to drive the vehicle. They also know the rules of the road. That has to be taken care of,\" the young MP said.\\nGadkari said while safety issues have been taken care of, at present there is no import of Chinese parts for these vehicles.\\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Ram Mohan Naidu,Lok Sabha,Gadkari,e-rickshaw,Central Motor Vehicle Act\\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\\x92s mobile apps.

The cabinet also decided that Sundays will no longer be dry days though working hours of bars will be reduced marginally.\\nChief minister Oommen Chandy said the government has decided to bring in the amendments following the report submitted by the tourism and labour secretaries who studied the impact of the new policy in their respective sectors.\\n\"It has been decided to bring down the working hours of bars from 15 hours a day to 12.30 hours. The timing of bars will be decided by the excise department based on this. The decision to lift dry days on Sundays has been taken following the report that the sale of liquor in Bevco outlets has increased by 60% on Saturdays. Apart from this the tourism industry was also severely affected by this decision,\\'\\' Chandy said.\\nThe bars which were functioning till March 31 this year, and which meet basic hygiene requirements, will be eligible to start beer and wine parlours. This decision has been taken to help employees in these bars who became jobless after the government decision.\\nIn the cabinet meeting, IUML leaders protested against the amendments, but Chandy sought to brush it away, saying, \"The IUML has always stood for total prohibition and they have difference of opinion with the UDF policy on this.\"\\nWhen asked whether new beer and wine parlour licenses will be issued, the CM said, \"The UDF did not take any decision for not giving fresh licenses.\\'\\' The cabinet also decided to maintain status quo on club licences.\\nOn shifting of Bevco outlets along the national and state highways as per the high court order, the cabinet decided to close down 10% of the outlets on January 1, 2015. \"There are 163 outlets along the national and state highways and it is not feasible to shift them. Hence it has been decided to close down these outlets in phases,\" Chandy said.\\nThe cabinet also decided to continue with the 5% cess imposed on liquor which will be utilised for rehabilitation of bar employees.\\nThe new amendments will be operational once orders are issued by the excise department.

According to state finance minister Amit Mitra, the aggregate revenue loss would be Rs 8,200 crore in the first year. The amount is almost 20% of the states own revenue generation of Rs 40,000 crore and 29% of the debt repayment of Rs 28,000 crore. The capital repayment out of this is Rs 9,000 crore which would be almost equal to revenue loss.\\nAlarmed at the haste of the Narendra Modi government that seems set to table the Bill in Parliament this session, state finance minister Amit Mitra has written to the chairman of the empowered committee of finance ministers A.R. Rather demanding an urgent discussion on the Constitution Amendment Bill.\\nGST is proposed as a destination based tax with tax revenues going to the consuming states. The states that consume more will be getting more tax, while producing states that export goods to other states will be apparently on the losing side. Producing states such as Bengal, Maharashtra have to tread with caution.\\nAlarmed at the haste of the Narendra Modi government that seems set to table the Bill in Parliament this session, the state finance minister has written to the chairman of the empowered committee A.R. Rather demanding an urgent discussion on the Constitution Amendment Bill.\\nMitra took exception to the Centre\\'s bid to push through the Bill without consulting the majority states when the Bill in its present form infringes upon the state\\'s autonomy to tax certain items at its own rates and also keep certain items namely crude petroleum, diesel, aviation turbine fuel and natural gas outside the GST net.\\nThe draft Bill includes petrol and petroleum products under the GST net when the Mamata Banerjee government had strongly objected against inclusion of these in the last meeting of the empowered committee meeting held on December 11. With most of the goods and services coming under the GST, the Bill also proposes to do away with the state\\'s power to levy tax on select items \\x97 \"declared goods\" as provided under Article 286 of the Constitution.\\nWhat\\'s more is the finance minister had urged to retain the state\\'s higher tax rate on tobacco and tobacco products. Accordingly, a meeting of the empowered committee of the finance ministers was called on December 11 to discuss the amendments to the draft Bill submitted by the states. Later, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley was present in the meeting of the empowered committee. As many as 29 states supported Bengal\\'s cause and the majority opposed the draft Bill in its present form, Mitra claimed.\\nThe Union finance then told the committee to form a sub group for further discussion. Accordingly a sub group was formed with Gujarat, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka without any representation from eastern states.\\nThe sub-group discussed the Bill later without circulating it to the state finance ministers and the draft Bill got the Cabinet nod. \"I have written a letter to Arun Jaitley on December 15 pointing to this fact. He asked me to meet him. But the chairman of the empowered committee A R Rather, the finance minister of J&K;, later told me that it will discussed in the committee before submission to cabinet. However, to our surprise we heard that it is tabled in the cabinet undermining the Empowered Committee and the federal structure,\" he added.\\nElaborating the tax implications, Mitra pointed out that if the petrol and petroleum products is subsumed in GST then the state may loose up to Rs 2,350 crore. It may be noted that petroleum products and tobacco are considerable revenue earner to this debt ridden state.\\nThis apart, sales tax on diesel in Bengal is 17% while that is on motor spirit (petrol) is 25%. There is a cess of Rs 1 as well on both diesel and MS along with some advalorem surcharges. The total revenue from of the state from this account is Rs 3,000 crore now. Besides, petrol and tobacco, the new draft of GST also proposed to subsume entry tax and CST is out of the divisible pool.\\nAccording to Mitra, in entry tax account the state would loose between Rs 1,200 crore and Rs 1,500 crore while in tobacco the loss will be Rs 350 crore. \"The major blow will be CST. Now the total due of the state on this account is Rs 78,000 crore and our due is Rs 4,500 crore from 2010. The centre is now offering only Rs 11,000 crore from this account to the states where we shall get only Rs 400 crore. The perpetual loss every year from this account would be Rs 2,600 crore which will be applicable from the second year of GST rolled out,\" the minister said. However, the Constitutional Bill has to be passed in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha by a two-third majority.\\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Narendra Modi government,GST,Goods and Services Tax,Amit Mitra\\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\\x92s mobile apps.

Not only did he enjoy the luxury of regular \"outings\" from prison to visit his family and friends, he was treated like a VVIP within the confines of the high-security prison and had a smooth traffic of visitors, most of them terror commanders seeking his guidance and advice.\\nLakhvi, who had monitored the carnage from the LeT control room in Karachi and given blow-by-blow instructions to the 26/11 Mumbai attackers, was at one time using five different cellphones inside the jail to communicate with LeT commanders and cadres. According to intelligence sources, he made calls freely to keep tab on the outfit\\'s operations and gave pep-talks to his terror associates.\\nAccording to a former Union home secretary, Lakhvi\\'s detention in Adiala Jail is even better than a house arrest. While a person under house arrest cannot leave the premises of his detention or receive any visitors unless authorized by the detaining authority, Lakhvi was allowed to use vehicles and security to meet his family and terror associates outside the jail premises.\\nLakhvi is known to have even fathered a child during incarceration, thanks to these \"outings\". Abu Jundal, the 26/11 handler who was deported to India in 2012, had told his interrogators here that Lakhvi, during one of their meetings in Adiala Jail, had informed him that the prison authorities had allowed his wife to visit him in prison in 2010 to perform conjugal rights, following which their son was born.\\nAccording to intelligence updates submitted to the government over a period of time, Lakhvi\\'s \"cell\" in Adiala Jail is a well-appointed suite with all modern facilities, including a television set. He has access to newspapers and moves within the jail without any restrictions. \"He is kept in good humour by the jailors and prison staff, under what the security agencies believe are standing instructions from Pakistani state agencies like the ISI,\" a senior intelligence officer told TOI.\\nIn fact, the jail authorities even arranged a birthday celebration for their most-coveted prisoner in 2012.\\nAgencies here believe that Lakhvi was arrested as Pakistan was under pressure from the Western nations. The arrest was meant to \"showcase\" Pakistan\\'s commitment to bring 26/11 perpetrators to book, while secretly ensuring that he was not isolated from his family or his \\'work\\' as a terror commander.\\nPakistan has turned down repeated requests from Indian agencies for Lakhvi\\'s voice samples, stating that its laws do not allow samples to be taken without the consent of the accused.\\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi,Rawalpindi\\x92s Adiala jail\\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\\x92s mobile apps.

Isn\\'t it simple to say that we will reach 50% first, or the metros, cities, and then the talukas? Why do we say 100% first, and then fail on it, and thereafter recriminate?\" Khullar said at a seminar \\'India - Broadband For All\\' organised by Ericsson and COAI. \"It is an impossible target, (and) you are bound to fail\".\\nThe Modi government plans to link village panchayats across the country by December 2016 through the national optical fibre network (NOFN). The idea is to provide broadband access to all through the programme, while promoting initiatives like e-governance, e-education and e-health.\\nKhullar said that a focus just on building optic fibre infrastructure \"is wrong\", but rather the government needs to focus on developing applications based on the requirements in the rural areas.

The DGCA action comes after the home ministry withdrew the mandatory security clearance to Jindal\\'s aircraft charter firm, said sources. No aviation company can operate without this clearance.\\nJSPL\\'s charter firm was given licence on December 23, 2008. According to the DGCA website, it has a luxury 13-seater Global Express (VT-JSB) and a nine-seater Cessna 560XL (VT-JSS). The Global Express had come under DGCA scanner earlier this year during the general election campaign period when a number of charter aircraft were checked and some even grounded, including those of the Reliance and Adani Group.\\nThis March, the Jindal Global Express was checked at Delhi airport and many lapses were reportedly found in it. This plane was checked along with Reliance\\'s Falcon 9X \\x97 a high end luxury jet \\x97 that is used mainly by Kokilaben Ambani, Mukesh and Anil\\'s mother. While the Reliance plane was grounded for a day, Jindal\\'s Global Express escaped that punishment. If the firm\\'s NSOP is cancelled, it may not take to the skies in a hurry.\\nA JSPL spokesperson said: \"JSPL has applied for the renewal in timely manner as provided by the law and has also followed it up in the regular course of business. We have just received a show-cause notice from DGCA on Tuesday, why our NSOP licence should not be withdrawn due to non-grant of security clearance. However, reasons for the non grant of security clearance have not been mentioned in the DGCA letter. Immediately, the next day, we replied to the show-cause notice asking DGCA, the detials of the reasons so that we can explain why NSOP licence deserves to be renewed. We are confident that there is no reason for the non renewal of NSOP. We await DGCA\\'s response for our further necessary action and are also exploring our legal options.\"\\nFEATURED ARTICLES\\n', u'The Times of India\\nYou are here: Home \\xa0\\u0165\\xa0 Business \\xa0\\u0165\\xa0India Business\\nBreaking News:\\nSign in to earn your Badges\\nModerator\\nFind and flag inappropriate comments on Timesofindia.com by marking them offensive.

Troubles at Kalanithi Maran-owned low cost carrier (LCC) started from mid-November when leasers started repossessing aircraft, leading to reduction of flights. As SpiceJet\\'s slashed its schedule, passengers of its cancelled flights made a beeline for other carriers \\x97 mainly IndiGo and Jet.\\nAccording to directorate general of civil aviation ( DGCA ) data, market shares of IndiGo and Jet shot up from October (when SpiceJet was flying its entire fleet) to November (see graph). Wadia Group\\'s GoAir also gained and carried more flyers.\\nState-owned Air India, which is being kept alive by pumping in thousands of crores of tax-payers\\' money, could not capitalize on the situation. It actually saw its market share drop by two percentage points from October to November. AI (domestic) even pipped SpiceJet in terms of numbers of passengers being affected by flight cancellations. As many as 4,242 AI passengers had seen their flights cancelled, while the figure for SpiceJet was 3,290. And, 27,200 AI (domestic) flyers faced delays of over two hours. \"The focus may be on SpiceJet but AI should be the real worry for the government,\" said an official.\\nMeanwhile on Thursday, sources said SpiceJet operated over 140 flights by evening and had six cancellations by then \\x97 out of its truncated schedule of 230 daily flights. Oil companies have put SpiceJet on cash-and-carry and the LCC is paying cash to get fuel.\\nFull service carriers, Jet and AI, are now planning to fill in the void created by SpiceJet\\'s flight reduction. They are both planning to deploy wide body aircraft on domestic routes. AI has three Boeing 777-200 (long range) which it will lease out by next summer. It plans to utilize these three twin aisle planes on domestic sector till then.\\nJet on Thursday introduced 12 additional daily flights on domestic routes. It will deploy wide body Airbus A-330 on routes like Delhi-Bengaluru-Delhi and Delhi-Chennai-Delhi from next Tuesday to January 29, 2015.\\nFEATURED ARTICLES\\n', u'The Times of India\\nYou are here: Home \\xa0\\u0165\\xa0 Business \\xa0\\u0165\\xa0India Business\\nBreaking News:\\nSign in to earn your Badges\\nModerator\\nFind and flag inappropriate comments on Timesofindia.com by marking them offensive.

(Reuters photo)\\nRELATED\\nWASHINGTON: The US Secret Service needs an outsider to overhaul the insular agency, beef up staffing and improve training \\x97 after building a higher fence around the White House, an independent review concluded on Thursday.\\nAn executive summary of the highly classified review revealed deep problems at the top of the Secret Service, which is charged with guarding the US president and other senior government officials.\\n\"The panel heard one common critique from those inside and outside the Service: The Service is too insular,\" the published summary said.\\nHomeland security secretary Jeh Johnson appointed a four-member independent panel in October after a Sept. 19 intrusion by an Iraq war veteran who scaled the White House fence, sprinted across the lawn and got deep inside the mansion before an off-duty agent stopped him.\\nThat incident prompted the panel\\'s first recommendation: build a better fence \"as soon as possible.\" It recommended one that is at least 4 or 5 feet (120 or 150cm) higher and curves outward at the top to give agents more time to assess the risk of a jumper.\\nBut the agency\\'s problems, it noted, \"go deeper than a new fence can fix.\"\\nA director not tied to agency traditions and personal relationships will be better equipped to do an honest reassessment and encourage a culture of accountability.\\nThe last Secret Service director, Julia Pierson, was a 30-year veteran who was tasked with cleaning up the agency\\'s culture after a 2012 presidential trip to Colombia in which up to a dozen agents were found to have hired prostitutes.\\nPierson resigned under fierce criticism on Oct 1, less than two weeks after the Sept. 19 White House intrusion. That fence jumper breach came a day after the disclosure that an armed private security contractor rode on an elevator with Obama in Atlanta in a breach of protocol earlier in September.\\nThe security lapses, along with a 2011 incident in which seven gunshots were fired at the White House, had raised concerns across Washington that Obama was not as well protected as he should be in an age of global tumult.\\nThe panel said special agents and uniformed division personnel work an \"unsustainable number of hours.\"\\n\"The Secret Service is stretched to and, in many cases, beyond its limits,\" the panel said. It recommended adding at least 85 special agents and 200 uniformed officers so the agency can shorten long shifts, reduce overtime and free up agents for regular training.\\nThe agency\\'s training regimen is far below acceptable levels, it said, with the average special agent receiving only 42 hours of training.\\n\"The panel\\'s recommendations are astute, thorough and fair,\" Johnson said in a statement.\\nRepublican Representative Jason Chaffetz, incoming chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on Thursday promised an independent congressional review of the agency.\\nThe panel acknowledged that many of its recommendations had been made before but never implemented.\\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=white house,US Secret Service,secret service,Oversight and Government Reform Committee\\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\\x92s mobile apps.

The story \\x97 at this point \\x97 remains just a sketchy outline, with Mr Sarraff hidden from public view and his work for the CIA still classified.\\nThe spy games between the two countries lost their urgency after the fall of the Soviet Union, but the spies have stuck to their roles for more than two decades: pilfering documents, breaking codes and enticing government officials to betray their countries. \"There were a number of people in the Cuban government who were valuable to the U.S., just as there were a number of people in the U.S. government who were helpful to the Cubans,\" said Jerry Komisar, who ran C.I.A. clandestine operations in Cuba during the 1990s.\\nWith Wednesday\\'s exchange of imprisoned spies and the leaders of the United States and Cuba talking in a substantive way for the first time in more than 50 years, some people who were part of the spy games between the two countries now wonder just how much it was worth it.\\nIn retrospect, Mr Komisar said, there was little need for American intelligence services to devote so much attention to Cuba \\x97 a country with a decrepit military that he said posed no strategic threat to the United States since the Soviet Union pulled its missiles off the island in 1962.\\nAfter decades of cloak-and-dagger activities between the two countries, he said, it turned out to be \"a draw.\"\\n\"You have to ask yourself, \\'To what end?\\' \" he said.\\nBefore he was arrested in November 1995, Mr Sarraff worked in the cryptology section of Cuba\\'s Directorate of Intelligence and was an expert on the codes used by Cuban spies in the United States to communicate with Havana. According to members of his family, he had studied journalism at the University of Havana and had the rank of first lieutenant at the intelligence directorate.\\nIt is not clear when Mr Sarraff, now 51, began working for the CIA Chris Simmons, who was the chief of a Cuban counterintelligence unit for the Defense Intelligence Agency from 1996 to 2004, said that he worked with another man \\x97 Jose Cohen, one of Mr Sarraff\\'s childhood friends \\x97 to pass encryption information to the C.I.A. that led to the arrest of a number of Cuban agents operating in the United States.\\nMr Simmons said that Cuba\\'s spy service regularly communicated with its agents in America using encrypted messages sent over shortwave radio. After Mr Sarraff helped the United States crack the codes, he said, the FBI was able to arrest Cuban spies years after Mr Sarraff was discovered and put in prison in Cuba.\\n\"When Roly was providing information, he was giving us insights about where there were weaknesses in the Cuban encryption system,\" Mr Simmons said.\\nCuban authorities arrested Mr Sarraff in November 1995 and put him on trial for espionage, revealing state secrets and other acts against state security. According to one senior American official, the Cuban government learned of his plans to defect when he was on assignment in a third country and recalled him to Cuba and put him in jail.\\nAccording to members of Mr Sarraff\\'s family, he went to work one day in 1995 and never came home. Cuban officials told the family for more than a week that Mr Sarraff was on a job in the country\\'s interior and would be back soon.\\nHe was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Mr Simmons, the former D.I.A. officer, said he believed that the reason Mr Sarraff was not executed was because his parents were officials in the Cuban government. \"He has always maintained his innocence\" his sister, Vilma Sarraff, said by telephone from Spain. She said that Mr Sarraff\\'s daughter was 7 when he was arrested.\\nMr Cohen escaped Cuba on a raft and was sentenced to death in absentia. He now lives in Miami and works as an Amway salesman. In an interview on Thursday, he insisted that neither he nor Mr Sarraff ever sold information. \"What I did I did because I admired the values of this country, and because what was happening in Cuba was a farce,\" he said.\\nMr Cohen declined to offer any details about the espionage, saying it was too dangerous to discuss the case without direct proof that Mr Sarraff had left Cuba. He said that the Cuban government never had any hard evidence to present against Mr Sarraff and said his friend\\'s case was politically motivated.\\n\"They sentenced me to death and then sentenced him to 25 years to serve as a lesson for everybody else,\" he said.\\nIn his speech Wednesday, Mr Obama referred to Mr Sarraff as \"one of the most important intelligence agents that the United States has ever had in Cuba,\" someone who \"provided America with the information that allowed us to arrest the network of Cuban agents that included the men transferred to Cuba today, as well as other spies in the United States.\"\\nHours later, the office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a statement saying the information from Mr Sarraff \\x97 the statement did not name him \\x97 had helped the government arrest and convict several Cuban spies inside the United States. The convictions included a senior analyst at the Defense Intelligence Agency named Ana Belen Montes; a former Department of State official, Walter Kendall Myers, and his wife, Gwendolyn Myers; and members of the Red Avispa network, or Wasp Network, in Florida.\\nMultiple news accounts in recent years have identified Mr Sarraff as a former Cuban intelligence officer who had been imprisoned. The accounts named him as a possible candidate to be released if the United States and Cuba were ever to agree to a spy swap.\\nSome people here said this Trujillo is a \"patriot\"? No, patriots are people who fight (or \"spy\") for their countries not for the enemy. The...\\nI am shocked that we would reward Cuba with an embassy when they treat their prisoners so horrifically. On the other hand we can...\\nWhat is the next trade? Tsarnaev for Snowden? This dangerous stuff trading criminals for criminals.\\nBut Ms. Sarraff said that if her brother had in fact collaborated with American intelligence agencies to help snare Cuban agents living in the United States, it was certainly not something he ever discussed with his family.\\n\"If what they are saying is true, fine, he paid that debt with 20 years in prison,\" she said.\\nMs. Sarraff said her brother was in solitary confinement for 18 years. An avid painter and poet, he was not permitted any painting supplies or other distractions. He was also denied parole, Ms. Sarraff said.\\nShe said that her brother had been calling his family regularly from prison, but that they had not heard from him in several days. She said her family had been told Mr Sarraff had been released from prison, but had not heard directly that he was part of a prisoner exchange.\\nShe said she had no idea where he was.\\n\"They did not say where they had taken him,\" she said, becoming irate.\\n\"How is it possible that they take my brother out of the country without telling his parents? My parents are at the point where my father is likely to have a heart attack!\"\\nSpeaking by phone from Havana, Mr Sarraff\\'s father, also named Rolando, said \"this is not a moment of happiness \\x97 it\\'s panic.\"\\n\"I have gone three days without knowing the whereabouts of my son,\" he said. He confirmed that his son had once worked for Cuba\\'s intelligence service.\\nAs Mr Sarraff\\'s family and friends wait to hear from him, his former partner in espionage said Mr Sarraff gave up his freedom for a cause he believed in.\\n\"Here\\'s what I can tell you about Roly: He is a person who loves liberty. He was jailed unjustly,\" Mr Cohen said.\\n\"He sacrificed his life. When he gets here, he will tell his story.\"\\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Rolando Sarraff Trujillo,Cuban spies,Cuban authorities,CIA Chris Simmons,CIA\\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\\x92s mobile apps.

The authority claimed that he was unable to perform his duties, for example, needing the help of a colleague to tie a child\\'s shoe-laces.\\nLegal experts had said that if Kaltoft who weighed more than 158 kg won the case, obesity would need to be approached just like any other physical or mental impairment, preventing an employer from treating an employee less favourably because of their weight. This would include the ability to dismiss.\\nThe court said that no provision of the Treaties or of secondary EU legislation prohibits discrimination on grounds of obesity as such. In particular, the Employment Equality Directive does not cite obesity as a ground for discrimination.\\nAs for whether obesity can constitute a \\'disability\\' within the meaning of the directive, the court observed that the purpose of the directive is to lay down a general framework for combating discrimination, in the area of employment and occupation, on any of the grounds referred to in the directive, which include disability.\\nIt said \"The concept of \\'disability\\' within the meaning of the directive must be understood as referring to a limitation which results in particular from long-term physical, mental or psychological impairments which in interaction with various barriers may hinder the full and effective participation of the person concerned in professional life on an equal basis with other workers.\"\\nFurthermore, the court observed that \"employers must take in each particular case so as to enable a person with a disability to have access to, participate in, or advance in employment (unless such measures result in a disproportionate burden being imposed on the employer).\"\\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=\\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\\x92s mobile apps.

The effect of any response, such as cyber retaliation or financial sanctions, could be limited, US experts said.\\nMore than three weeks after the attack by hackers identifying themselves as \"Guardians of Peace\" brought down the computer network at Sony Pictures Entertainment, one of Hollywood\\'s biggest studios grappled with the losses to its operation and reputation through sensitive leaked emails.\\nSony decided on Wednesday to scrap its big Christmas Day release of \"The Interview,\" a comic film that culminates in the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Movie theater chains said they would not show the film citing security concerns after hackers made threats against cinemas and audiences.\\nA senior North Korean UN diplomat declined to comment on accusations that Pyongyang was responsible for the hacking attack on Sony Pictures. He also declined to comment on the delay of the release of the film.\\nAfter the cancellation, Sony began pulling promotion of the $44 million film, dismantling the giant promotional billboard on Hollywood\\'s famed Sunset Boulevard on Thursday.\\nSome of the Hollywood\\'s biggest names howled over the cancellation of the film starring James Franco and Seth Rogen, the latter also a co-director on the movie with partner Evan Goldberg.\\nSteve Carell, who has starred alongside Rogen in numerous comedies, said \"Sad day for creative expression.\"\\nThe hacking could hit Carell more directly. A film project called \"Pyongyang,\" a paranoid thriller starring the actor that was to be set in North Korea, was scrapped by producer New Regency, Deadline.com reported.\\nNeither Rogen nor Goldberg would comment on Thursday on the fate of their film amid grassroots efforts like screenings and petitions to keep the movie alive and honor the filmmakers.\\nSCREENINGS CANCELLED\\nThree movie houses called off special screenings of 2004 Paramount Pictures puppet-comedy \"Team America: World Police\" in which a US paramilitary force tries to foil a plot by then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, father of Kim Jong Un.\\nThe Alamo Drafthouse in Texas scrapped the screening because of \"circumstances beyond our control,\" while the Ohio-based Capitol Theatre and the Plaza in Atlanta said their screenings were canceled by Paramount.\\nRepresentatives for Paramount were not immediately available to comment.\\nSony said Wednesday it has no further plans to release \"The Interview,\" but that has not stopped speculation that another company or maybe even Sony itself would aim for a smaller distribution some time in the future.\\nSony\\'s embattled executives continued efforts to undo damage to their reputation wrought by the leaking of sensitive emails hacked in the November attack.\\nCivil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton met Thursday with Sony Pictures Co-Chairman Amy Pascal to discuss racially insensitive emails from her, included joking remarks related to US President Barack Obama and his taste in movies.\\nBut Sharpton stopped short of asking for her resignation.\\n\"The jury is still out on where we go with Amy,\" Sharpton said. \"We\\'re not going to be satisfied until we see something concrete done.\"\\nIt was still unclear what the costs to Sony Pictures would be for cancelling \"The Interview\" and for the cyberattack.\\nAny losses will undermine Sony Corp\\'s goal to boost results at the film studio as the money-losing conglomerate undergoes a restructuring and tries to counter flagging smartphone sales. Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai told investors in November that he aimed to lift its movie entertainment revenues by more than a third in the next three years.\\nWhile Rogen last week praised Pascal for having the courage to make the film, the long-time executive might be in a fight to keep her job because of that decision.\\n\"If you look at some of the emails, you have to go back and research, and look at her discussions with the head of Sony overall in Japan, they never wanted to make this movie in the first place,\" Mike Paul, crisis management consultant and president of Reputation Doctor LLC, told Reuters Insider.\\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=sony hack\\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\\x92s mobile apps.

Stinney Jr\\'s father had been part of the search team that found the girls\\' bodies hours later in a ditch, badly beaten with crushing blows to their skulls.\\nStinney Jr had been arrested and executed within the space of around three months. Executioners noted that he was too small for the electric chair when he died; the straps did not fit him, an electrode was too big for his leg, and the boy had to sit on a bible to fit properly in the chair.\\nHis case has long been spoken of as an example of how a black person could be railroaded by a justice system during the era of Jim Crow segregation laws where the investigators, prosecutors and juries where all white.\\nThe boy\\'s family have insisted that he was innocent, and in January they asked a local judge to order a re-trial and clear Stinney Jr\\'s name, claiming there was new evidence about the crime.\\nAime Ruffner receives support from family and friends after testifying at the hearing to reopen the case for her brother George Stinney Jr. in Sumter, South Carolina.\\nThis time Stinney Jr\\'s case was given a two day hearing in which experts questioned his confession and the autopsy findings, while the judge heard accounts from the boy\\'s surviving brothers and sisters, and someone who had been involved in the search. Most of the evidence from the original trial was gone and almost all the witnesses were dead.\\nIt took Mullen nearly four times as long to return her decision on Stinney Jr\\'s case than it had originally taken to arrest and have him executed in 1944, and said in her ruling that she could \"think of no greater injustice\" than the boy\\'s case.\\nDefense witness Katherine Stinney-Robinson leaves the stand after her testimony at the hearing to reopen the case for her brother George Stinney Jr. in Sumter, South Carolina.\\nJudge Mullen found that Stinney Jr\\'s confession was \"highly likely\" to have been coerced by authorities, while few or no witnesses were found to have testified in the trial.\\nThe judge said she was overturning the boy\\'s conviction because the South Carolina court had failed to grant a fair trial in 1944.\\nAdditional reporting by AP\\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=\\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\\x92s mobile apps.

Police have so far not commented on the chain of events.\\nAbbott has kept a high profile through the siege drama but has come under criticism from some quarters, notably about his decision to release details of a huge blow-out in the budget deficit as Australia was gripped by the unfolding Sydney events.\\nInfluential broadcaster Ray Hadley, who has long backed Abbott and his conservative Liberal Party, told him during a face-to-face interview he rated his performance as \"D-\", saying going ahead with the budget outlook was \"a really poor call\".\\nThe siege has touched a nerve among Australians, who began laying flowers at a makeshift memorial in the heart of Sydney\\'s financial quarter on Tuesday.\\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=Tony Abbott\\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\\x92s mobile apps.

The man had forced two or three young women to stand in front of him as human shields, so police snipers couldn\\'t take shots at him.\\nO\\'Brien glanced up at Stefan Balafoutis, a lawyer, who was standing, as ordered, with his hands against the window. The younger man had his eyes closed.\\n\"I said to the barrister, look, this is not going to end well, this guy will never get out of here alive, and he\\'s going to take everyone with him,\" O\\'Brien told Associated Press in the first detailed account from a hostage who was held inside the cafe.\\nHe whispered his plan to Balafoutis. The lawyer replied: \"Good idea.\"\\nO\\'Brien was exhausted and was wondering at times if he was in a dream. He hadn\\'t eaten since early in the morning, before their ordeal began, when he\\'d ordered a piece of raisin toast and a cappuccino.\\nHe thought the coffee at the Lindt Chocolat Cafe in Martin Place was creamy and delicious, albeit overpriced.

He\\'d visit a few times a year, often after an appointment with his eye doctor like the one he\\'d had that morning.\\nO\\'Brien was eating his toast when 50-year-old Man Haron Monis strode in, wearing a bandanna with Arabic writing. He pulled out a shotgun. O\\'Brien looked at it, thinking it was the size of a tennis racket. He knew right away the situation was dire. The gunman grabbed Tori Johnson, the 34-year-old cafe manager, ordering him to lock the door. O\\'Brien said Monis was immediately aggressive and belligerent.\\nThere were 17 people in the cafe that Monday who became the gunman\\'s hostages. Several were cafe staff in their early 20s. The customers included three lawyers and four bank workers who had popped in from nearby offices. O\\'Brien was the oldest while Jarrod Hoffman, a 19-year-old university student and a cafe staffer, was the youngest.\\nMonis ordered the customers to stand with their hands on the cafe window and to hold up a black Shahada flag with the Islamic declaration of faith written on it. O\\'Brien said he stood with his hands on the window for 30 minutes, or maybe 45, it was hard to tell, before telling the gunman how old he was and saying he needed to sit down.\\nIt was his first challenge to the gunman\\'s authority and a bit of a ruse, he said.

He thought about his wife, Maureen, whose brother had died two weeks earlier. He thought about his two daughters. And he thought about the gunman, who he became convinced was mad.\\nO\\'Brien quietly slipped out of his seat and sat on the floor. He\\'d noticed that near the cafe\\'s front doors, there was a gap between the wall and a large advertising placard, which was perhaps 10 feet (3 meters) wide and 5 feet (1.5 meters) high. He figured the gap was less than a foot (0.3 meters) wide but knew he had to squeeze behind the sign, and reach the button controlling the doors, if his plan was to work.\\nAfter several tries, he got behind the sign. Now the placard was obscuring him from the gunman. He lay down, and looked at the large green button on the wall. He wasn\\'t sure it would open the glass doors. If it didn\\'t, he figured, he would be seen by the gunman and killed.\\nAlso weighing on his mind was the thought of leaving the others behind. He didn\\'t want to, of course, and he had no way of knowing how the gunman might react.\\n\"I was terribly worried for them,\" he said.\\nBut there was no turning back. He reached up and pushed the green button. A moment later, at 3:37pm, the doors opened and he was free.\\nThe images of O\\'Brien running toward the police in his blue blazer, glancing back with Balafoutis close behind, were played around the world.

This is particularly true in Moscow, where people have become accustomed to imported goods and foreign travel, now once again off-limits for many because of the fall of the ruble and Western sanctions over Ukraine.\\nThe poll was conducted between November 22 and December 7, when the ruble was steadily declining. But this week\\'s catastrophic collapse is likely to have a much greater effect on consumer prices and the standard of living.\\nFor Putin, the question is whether he will be able to convince Russians to tighten their belts, and not just for a few months but possibly for years to come.\\n\"The Russian people have a sense that they are under sanctions, they are a fortress under siege,\" said Maria Lipman, an independent analyst. \"This kind of mentality is disseminated consistently and steadily by Russian television: Who else is there to rely on except Putin? Putin is seen as the savior of the nation, and I think he sees himself in this fashion.\"\\nPutin will address his countrymen\\'s concerns over the course of three or four hours at Thursday\\'s news conference. He seems all but certain to send the message that he is in charge and all is fine.\\nAn advertisement for the news conference running on state television shows Putin surrounded by Sochi Olympic athletes, petting a baby tiger and greeting cosmonauts. \"We are absolutely capable of doing everything ourselves,\" he promises the audience.\\nHow Russians view Putin is associated with how they get their news, the poll showed. Those who identified state television as their main source of news are more likely to approve of Putin (84 percent) than those who have other sources (73 percent), while those who tune into the news often also have a more favorable opinion of him.\\nAfter becoming president in 2000, Putin benefited from high prices for oil, the mainstay of Russia\\'s economy. In the past decade, Russians saw their living standards rise faster than at any other point in modern history, transforming many average citizens into car owners and globe-trotters for the first time ever.\\nThe suppression of opposition politicians and independent media, widely criticized by outside observers, was tacitly accepted by many as a compromise worth making for economic stability after the roller coaster years of the 1990s.\\n\"I very much support Putin - who else is there to support?\" said Valentina Roshupkina, a 79-year-old resident of Gryaz, a town several hours\\' drive south of Moscow. \"The country is moving in the right direction, I believe, because he lifted up the army, he made the government stronger. People started to be a little bit afraid of us.\"\\nPoll respondents were asked whether they would be willing to speak with an AP reporter, and Roshupkina was among the many who agreed.\\nWith the Russian economy buffeted by Western sanctions and the fall in oil prices, Putin has relied even more on his image as a tough leader capable of standing up to the West. He appears to be betting that this will help him weather the economic storm.\\nSo far he\\'s been right: The presidency and the military are the country\\'s most trusted institutions, according to the poll, with three out of four Russians saying they trust the presidency and two out of three expressing faith in the military.\\n\"We\\'ve revived the army and that\\'s very important,\" said Ivan Savenko, a 50-year-old driver in the southern city of Stavropol who also took part in the poll. \"For us, the most important thing is the army and then everything else. It\\'s important for us that our country is a power. If we are not a power, we do not exist.\"\\nOf those surveyed, 81 percent said they strongly or somewhat approve of the way Putin is handling his job, a dramatic increase of more than 20 percentage points from an AP-GfK poll conducted in 2012.\\nWhile Russia has become more authoritarian under Putin, the support for him appears genuine. The significant fluctuation in Putin\\'s ratings in recent years also indicates that Russians feel able to respond freely in anonymous surveys about their views on the president. The 81 percent approval rating is only slightly higher statistically than the 74 percent measured during the same time period by the Levada Center, Russia\\'s most respected independent pollster.\\nMany analysts question, however, whether the high ratings have any significance, given the Kremlin\\'s control over information.\\n\"There is a total, effective, monopolistic propaganda campaign, and if there is an information monopoly, how can you talk about ratings?\" said Georgy Satarov, a former Kremlin adviser who heads a research institute that studies corruption.\\n\"The thing you have to pay attention to is not the fact that 80 percent support him, but that despite that information monopoly 15 percent don\\'t support him,\" he said.\\nSupport for Putin soared after he moved to seize the Russian-speaking Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March.\\n\"A source of pride for the overwhelming majority of Russians is the victory of World War II, but that was already 70 years ago,\" Lipman said. \"(In Crimea) Putin gave the sense that we are victorious and triumphant and resurgent today.\"\\nThe Russia-backed separatists who took up arms against government troops in eastern Ukraine also have been portrayed as heroes on state television. Of the Russians polled, 69 percent said that many or some parts of Ukraine rightfully belong to Russia.\\nBut some, like 37-year-old librarian Yelena Shevilyova, said that although she approves of Putin, she believes Russia\\'s involvement in Ukraine may have come at too high a cost.\\n\"I think we lost a lot in our lives because of this,\" said Shevilyova, another poll participant, referring to Crimea.\\n\"I think that it is right to bring all of these (Russian-speaking regions) back, but we need everything to be good here too. ... You can\\'t have everything at once,\" she said, speaking from the far northern region of Perm.\\nGrowing worries about a worsening economy and the impact of sanctions are more keenly felt in major cities. In Moscow, more than 6 in 10 said they had been negatively affected by the sanctions and most said their family\\'s finances were worse than three years ago. Less than half felt that way elsewhere.\\n\"I am afraid that Russia isn\\'t going anywhere,\" said Dmitry Uryupin, 48, a sound director in a small production firm in Moscow who was among those surveyed. \"It\\'s unlikely that wages will be raised. In fact, it\\'s quite likely the opposite will happen, unemployment will rise and it will all affect the most economically insecure people as well as us, the creative class.\"\\nAfter Putin was inaugurated for a third term in 2012 after a wave of protests in Moscow driven by the creative class, he clamped down even harder on the opposition and focused on his core electorate: people in the provinces and those more dependent on the state for their income.\\nThe disgruntled in Moscow have proved easy to discredit in the eyes of what is known as the Putin majority: \"Look at these poor Muscovites. ... Oh my God, they complain because they cannot go to Italy on vacation and they can no longer afford to buy Parmesan cheese!\" Lipman said.\\nWhether discontent not just with the economy but with Putin\\'s leadership will grow, Lipman said, depends on \"how badly this will hurt, and for how long.\"\\nThe AP-NORC Center poll of Russia was conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago with fieldwork for the in-person survey by GfK Russia from November 22-December 7. It is based on 2,008 in person interviews with a nationally representative random sample of Russians age 18 and older.\\nFunding for the survey came from NORC at the University of Chicago.\\nResults for all adults have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.4 percentage points.\\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/followceleb.cms?alias=World War II,University of Chicago,Ukraine,Moscow,economy\\nStay updated on the go with The Times of India\\x92s mobile apps.

Uniformed schoolchildren burst into applause at the news.\\nAt the University of San Geronimo in the capital\\'s historic center, the announcement drew ringing from the bell tower. Throughout the capital, there was a sense of euphoria as word spread.\\n\"For the Cuban people, I think this is like a shot of oxygen, a wish-come-true, because with this, we have overcome our differences,\" said Carlos Gonzalez, a 32-year-old IT specialist. \"It is an advance that will open the road to a better future for the two countries.\"\\nFidel and  Raul Castro led the 1959 rebellion that toppled the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. The US initially recognized the new government but broke relations in 1961 after Cuba veered sharply to the left and nationalized US-owned businesses.\\nAs Cuba turned toward the Soviet Union, the US imposed a trade embargo in 1962. Particularly since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, Cubans have confronted severe shortages of oil, food and consumer goods, forcing them to ration everything from beans to powdered milk.\\nThe Cuban government blames most of its economic travails on the embargo, while Washington has traditionally blamed Cuba\\'s Communist economic policies.\\nIn his address, Castro called on Washington to end its trade embargo which, he said, \"has caused enormous human and economic damage.\"\\nRamon Roman, 62, said he hoped to see Cuba welcome more tourists. \"It would be a tremendous economic injection, both in terms of money and in new energy and would be a boost for average people who need it,\" he said.\\nVictoria Serrano, a lab worker, said she hoped to see an influx of new goods because life in Cuba has been \"really very difficult.\"\\n\"In particular,\" she said, \"I hope we\\'ll see an improvement in food _ that there is trade in this with the United States, which is so close. Right now, even an onion has become a luxury.\"\\nAround the cathedral in Old Havana, people gathered in doorways and on sidewalks, gesturing excitedly as they discussed the news.\\nGuillermo Delgado, a 72-year-old retiree, welcomed the announcement as \"a victory for Cuba because it was achieved without conceding basic principles.\"\\nYoani Sanchez, a renowned Cuban blogger critical of the government, noted the development came with a price. Castro, she said, could now claim a triumph and that he had made a \"bargaining chip\" of Alan Gross, the US aid worker who was released from prison Wednesday while the US freed three Cubans held as spies.\\n\"In this way, the Castro regime has managed to get its way,\" she wrote in a blog post. \"It has managed to exchange a peaceful man, embarked on the humanitarian adventure of providing Internet connectivity to a group of Cubans, for intelligence agents that caused significant damage and sorrow with their actions.\"\\nSome dissidents expressed their displeasure at not being consulted by the US government about the historic move.\\nDissident Guillermo Farinas considered the move a \"betrayal\" by Obama who, he said, had promised that they would be consulted. Another activist, Antonio Rodiles, said the measure \"sends a bad message.\"\\nOthers, meanwhile, were cautious, saying they\\'ll wait and see what it all means.\\n\"It\\'s not enough since it doesn\\'t lift the blockade,\" said Pedro Duran, 28. \"We\\'ll see if it\\'s true, if it\\'s not like everything here: one step forward and three steps back.

(Reuters photo)\\nPage 1  of 4\\nNEW YORK: Under the threat of terrorist attacks from hackers and with the nation's largest multiplex chains pulling the film from their screens,  Sony Pictures Entertainment took the unprecedented step of canceling the Dec. 25 release of the  Seth Rogen comedy ''The Interview.''\\nThe cancellation announced Wednesday was a startling blow to the Hollywood studio that has been shaken by hacker leaks and intimidations over the last several weeks by an anonymous group calling itself  Guardians of Peace.\\nA U.S. official said Wednesday that federal investigators have now connected the Sony hacking to North Korea and are expected to make an announcement in the near future. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to openly discuss an ongoing criminal case.\\nSony said it was cancelling ``The Interview'' release ``in light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film.'' The studio said it respected and shared in the exhibitors' concerns.\\n``We are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie, and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public,'' read the statement. ``We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome.''\\nSeemingly putting to rest any hope of a delayed theatrical release or a video-on-demand release Sony Pictures spokesperson Jean Guerin later added: ``Sony Pictures has no further release plans for the film.''\\nEarlier Wednesday, Regal Cinemas, AMC Entertainment and Cinemark Theatres _ the three top theater chains in North America _ announced that they were postponing any showings of ``The Interview.'' The comedy, about a TV host (James Franco) and producer (Rogen) tasked by the CIA to assassinate North Korea leader Kim Jung-un (played by Randall Park), has inflamed North Korea for parodying its leader.\\nRegal said in a statement that it was delaying ``The Interview'' ``due to wavering support of the film ... by Sony Pictures, as well as the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats.'' AMC noted ``the overall confusion and uncertainty'' surrounding the film.\\nSony had offered theaters the option of bowing out, and when so many of them did (other chains to drop it included ArcLight Cinemas, Cineplex Entertainment and Carmike Cinemas), Sony was left with little choice.\\nOn Tuesday, the hacking group threatened violence at ``the very times and places'' showing ``The Interview.'' The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday there was ``no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters,'' but noted it was still analyzing messages from the group. The warning did prompt law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles to address measures to ramp up security.\\nPresident Barack Obama commented the hacking Wednesday in an interview with ABC News.\\n``The cyberattack is very serious,'' said Obama. ``We're investigating and we're taking it seriously. We'll be vigilant. If we see something that we think is serious and credible then we'll alert the public. But for now, my recommendation would be that people go to the movies.''\\nWith a modest budget of about $40 million, ``The Interview'' was predicted to earn around $30 million in its opening weekend before Tuesday's threats. Sony also stands to lose tens of millions in marketing costs already incurred.\\n``This attack went to the heart and core of Sony's business _ and succeeded,'' said Avivah Litan, a cybersecurity analyst at research firm Gartner. ``We haven't seen any attack like this in the annals of U.S. breach history.''\\nSony was also under pressure from other studios. Christmas is one of the most important box-office weekends of the year, and the threats could have scared moviegoers away. Releases include Universal's ``Unbroken,'' Paramount's ``The Gambler,'' and Disney's ``Into the Woods.'' Sony's musical ``Annie,'' also expected to be a big earner, debuts Friday.\\nDoug Stone, president of film industry newsletter Box Office Analyst, had predicted that ``The Interview'' could have made $75 to $100 million. With Sony taking about 55 percent of domestic revenues, that could mean a $41 to $55 million revenue loss, according to Stone.\\nSony's announcement was met with widespread distress across Hollywood and by others watching the unfolding attack on Sony. A former senior national security official in the George W. Bush administration said the company made the wrong decision.\\n``When you are confronted with a bully the idea is not to cave but to punch him in the nose,'' Fran Townsend, Bush's homeland security adviser, said Wednesday during a previously scheduled appearance in Washington. ``This is a horrible, I think, horrible precedent.''\\n\", u'The Times of India\\nYou are here: Home \\xa0\\u0165\\xa0 World \\xa0\\u0165\\xa0Middle East\\nRELATED ARTICLES\\nMass grave of 230 killed by jihadists found in Syria: monitor\\nThe author has posted comments on this article\\nAFP | Dec 18, 2014, 04.15AM IST\\nRebel fighters walk around al-Hamidiyeh base, one of two military posts they took control of from forces loyal to Syria\\'s President Bashar al-Assad in the northwestern province of Idlib December 15, 2014.

The Mystery of the Sony Pictures Hack\\nBy Jane Wakefield Technology reporter\\nSony Pictures computer system hacked\\nIt has become the whodunnit that is gripping Hollywood without a penny being spent on production.\\nNow The Mystery of the Sony Pictures Hack - which already had all the ingredients for a major Hollywood film - has taken a new twist as the movie at the heart of the row is pulled.\\nThat raises a whole host of questions but the key one - who was behind the attack - remains unanswered.\\nTo help get to the bottom of the mystery, the BBC turned detective and considered the evidence.\\nWhat we know so far:\\nWhat isn\\'t in doubt, despite Sony\\'s desire to write a script where it wakes up and it was all a bad dream, is that the film giant\\'s internal computer system was hacked in November.\\nThe group responsible called itself The Guardians of Peace and warned that if its demands were not met, secret data would be \"shown to the world\". Crucially though it did not outline its demands.\\nA number of as-yet unreleased films popped up on online download sites. The Interview, a comedy featuring a plot to assassinate North Korea\\'s leader Kim Jong-un, was not among those released.\\nThe hackers also released the salary and social security numbers of thousands of Sony employees - including celebrities.\\nFollowing threats of 9/11 style incidents at any cinema that screened the film from the group behind the hack, Sony announced that it was cancelling the release of the movie altogether.\\nWho are the prime suspects?\\nA nation state, most likely North Korea\\nSupporters of North Korean regime, based in China\\nHackers with a money-making motive\\nHackers or a lone individual with another motive, such as revenge\\nThe case for North Korea:\\nThe leadership made no secret of its anger at the imminent release of The Interview\\nThe case for North Korea being behind the attack seems, at least on the face of it, to be a compelling one.\\nIt has a motive and a history of hacking.\\nIts leadership certainly did not disguise its anger about the forthcoming Sony film The Interview.\\nIn fact, it described the film as \"an act of terrorism\".\\nAnd rather like a robbery being pinned on a local criminal who has a history of similar offences, North Korea has form.\\nMany are pointing the finger of suspicion firmly towards the crime Unit 121 of North Korea\\'s General Bureau of Reconnaissance, described by some commentators as the country\\'s most elite hacking unit.\\nAnd shortly after news that the film was pulled, the New York Times ran an article quoting an unnamed government source as saying it believed that attack to be state-sponsored with the North Korean government involved.\\nThe case against:\\nWho else might be to blame?\\nIt might not be the most compelling evidence but it is worth noting that  North Korea denied that it was behind the attack, saying instead that it was the work of someone sympathetic to its cause. It hardly ever bothers to deny such claims.\\nNorth Korea is not averse to a bit of hacking but many say that the history of this particular crime does not fit with its modus operandus.\\nIts usual target is South Korea where attacks such as one launched in March 2013 have taken down internal networks.\\nBlogger Marc Rogers drills down into the details of this particular hack.\\nHe concludes that the fact that the code was written on a PC with Korean locale and language actually makes it less likely North Korea is the source.\\nHe points out that they do not speak traditional Korean in North Korea, they speak their own dialect and traditional Korean is forbidden.\\n\"Let\\'s not forget also that it is trivial to change the language/locale of a computer before compiling code on it,\" he writes.\\nHe also points out that the the hackers are very net and social-media savvy. \"That and the sophistication of the operation, do not match with the profile of the DPRK (Democratic People\\'s Republic of Korea).\"\\nBut perhaps his most compelling piece of evidence is the fact that the attackers only latched onto The Interview connection after the media suggested that North Korea might be linked to the attack.\\nSo if not North Korea then who?\\nWho else would have a motive for the attack?\\nIn his blog, Mr Rogers writes \"I would find the presence of Chinese far more plausible\" and others also think that Chinese hackers, possibly recruited by North Korea, are a far more likely source of the malware.\\nOther think it may be hackers out to make some money.\\nWhen the hack was first reported there was little to suggest a monetary motive but actually the hackers emailed five top Sony Pictures executives on November 21, days before they began leaking the files, and demanded money.\\nSean Sullivan, a senior researcher at security company F-Secure, believes extortion could be the motive behind the hack.\\n\"That is a lot more credible than a nation state,\" he told the BBC.\\nFor him, the real test will  be what the hackers do next.\\nIf the pulling of The Interview was their primary motive, things should quieten down but if there are more data dumps, then he thinks everyone should pretty much dismiss North Korea as the source.\\n\"I would even bet they dump The Interview on to a torrent site unless Sony puts some money in a brown paper bag,\" he said.\\nLike Mr Rogers, he does not rule out the involvement of Chinese hackers.\\n\"It is far more likely that North Korea would have recruited Chinese hackers who both wanted to make some money and cause Sony pain,\" he said.\\nIf the sorry tale were to be turned into a Hollywood movie and, given the times we live in, it almost certainly will - although probably not made by Sony - a better plotline might be anonymous hackers intent on revenge.\\nTo understand how this might be a possibility requires a bit of a trawl through the history of Sony and hacking.\\nIts battle with hackers began in 2005 when its music division installed software which modified computer operating systems to prevent CDs being copied. It continued in 2010 when Sony took on teenaged hacker George Hotz who jailbroke his PlayStation 3 and released the code.\\nIts most high-profile attack happened in April 2011 when hacking group Anonymous launched a campaign to bring down the PlayStation Network. The attackers gaining access to the personal information of more than 77 million users. The hack cost Sony at least $171m.\\nAs Chester Wisniewski, a senior security adviser at Sophos, put it in an interview with Gizmodo . \"Sony\\'s been raising the ire of hackers for as long as I can remember, so you have to think that they\\'ve known they\\'re a serious target.\"\\nFor Mr Roberts, the most obvious suspect, like many of the best whodunnits, may be far closer to home.\\n\"My money is on a disgruntled (possibly ex) employee of Sony,\" he concludes.\\nWill the case ever make it to court?\\nIt is debatable whether those responsible for the attack will ever be brought to justice. The US government has said that, if the hackers do turn out to be North Korean, it will be very difficult to prosecute them.\\nAnd while many may speculate on other suspects, hard evidence is proving elusive.\\n\"The jury is out - North Korea is definitely a suspect. It had opportunity and the means but to convict them you need more evidence,\" said security expert from the University of Surrey Prof Alan Woodward.\\nWhat everyone does agrees is that the ripple effects from the attack will be felt long after the commentators have stopped asking who is to blame.\\nSony Pictures faces a long road to redeeming its reputation and gaining back the trust of Hollywood.\\nAmerica faces the hardest of questions about whether, by withdrawing the film, is has given into threats in a way it usually refuses to do.\\nAnd the IT bosses of corporations around the world may just as well cancel all their Christmas leave as chief executives demand immediate reviews of their security procedures in a desperate attempt to make sure they never fall foul of similar embarrassing leaks.\\nFor Mr Sullivan the hack represents a good moment for corporate America to scrutinise its security arrangements. While it might seem easy to blame a nation state it is time to sit up and acknowledge that this could have happened to any number of firms.\\nHe hopes there will be \" a decent post-mortem\".\\nUntil then though The Most Mysterious Case of the Sony Hack will remain like Charles Dickens\\' final novel - The Mystery of Edwin Drood - unfinished.\\nMore on This Story\\nDid Vladimir Putin gamble on high oil prices lasting for ever?\\nMost Popular\\n', u'Asians flock to social networks for shopping sprees\\nBy Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani Business Reporter, BBC News, Singapore\\nDora\\'s become a fashion icon in Singapore influencing young women\\'s shopping habits\\nCashless in Cape Town\\nSingaporean student Dora Soh posts her \"outfit of the day\" online every day, to connect with fellow fashionistas and inspire her nearly 10,000 followers on Instagram.\\nThe 22-year-old\\'s shopping habits have become so influential that online retailers are now sponsoring her to wear their clothes, in hopes that her posts will boost their brand and sales.\\nOnline retailers sponsoring Dora include Singaporean brands The Tinsel Rack, MGP and Mint & Ooak\\n\"On social media, I can interact with strangers and share fashion inspiration by following their accounts and liking their photos,\" Ms Soh says.\\nWhile this sounds like a simple formula to keep up with the latest fashion trends, the avid shopper is at the forefront of a rapidly growing business in Asia - social shopping.\\nGlobal retailers are pulling out all the stops to increase their presence on social networks with technology that allows you to broadcast your latest fashion find online, even before it rings through the register.\\nFor example, on Singapore-based social network and shopping website clozette.co , users can upload a picture of an item, or focus in on someone else\\'s post, and hit search to find similar outfits for sale.\\nIt is as exact as narrowing in on nail art on someone\\'s finger nails, to search on the website\\'s database of two million items from nearly 5,000 global brands.\\n\"I truly believe we\\'re the first company in the world to do that - intelligent visual recognition,\" says the website\\'s co-founder and chief executive Roger Yuen.\\nSocial platforms take off\\nMr Yuen says growth has skyrocketed on his social media platform, which allows users to create and share their personal wardrobes, as well as buy and sell items from each other and retailers in Asia.\\n\"We have close to 400,000 registered members in the region, and as a company we have a reach of about seven million unique users a month,\" he says.\\nThe firm launched in 2010 with just under 80,000 users in its first year.\\nUsers can create their own virtual wardrobes or raid through others\\' to find the latest fashion trends\\nSingapore based beauty box start-up Vanitytrove.com/sg has also seen tremendous growth since it launched its user content-driven platform earlier this year.\\nCo-founder and chief executive Douglas Gan says about 100-150 new members join the website every day, to browse or post about new products, and chat with like-minded beauty experts.\\n\"We have over 60,000 female members on the platform in Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand,\" he says. \"We figured that if we want consumers to make a conscious decision before they buy something, we should give them a platform.\"\\nUsers share makeup tips and beauty product must-haves on Vanitytrove\\n\\'Word of mouth\\'\\nRapid growth for such fashion-based social networks is not surprising considering recent figures that showed more and more Asians are turning to social media to shape their shopping habits, outpacing other regions of the world.\\nIn a study of 10,000 consumers worldwide, consulting firm AT Kearney found over 95% of people aged between 16 and 45 in China said the chatter on social networks has at some point influenced their online shopping decisions.\\nMeanwhile, 61% of Chinese respondents said they \"frequently\" based purchases on what was happening in their social network - almost double the global average of 32%.\\nIn consumer giant India, over 82% of people aged 16-35 said happenings on their social network influenced their buying habits.\\nEven among the older generation -

so that it automatically reduces the trust people have in official communication.\"\\nTrusting someone who has your best interests in mind, like a close friend or acquaintance, or even someone that is slightly more removed but in your network, is much more compelling, he adds\\n\"If you look at China in particular, there\\'s been so many food scandals, and so many items that may be counterfeit, and may not deliver what they promise. In general the level of trust [in retailers] is lower.\"\\nAsian consumers look for reassurance when shopping to ensure they are getting authentic merchandise\\nRetailers\\' virtual push\\nAs a result, a lot of consumer goods companies and retailers in Asia are trying to engage with consumers through social media, and create word of mouth in the virtual world.\\nRetailers that have been successful in creating a buzz online are using a range of tactics from promising shoppers discounts if they post \"selfies\" wearing their merchandise, to creating online communities based on competitions or events.\\nOutdoor clothing outlet The North Face\\'s strategy in China this year gained momentum after it launched a competition for consumers to be \"The Next Explorer\", and win a trip to the US.\\nThe competition resulted in more than 200,000 new members to its online community, where participants talk about products and connect with each other to organise events such as hiking trips.\\nMembers post about adventure trips they have taken on The North Face Chinese website\\n\"It has taken on a life of its own. North Face is behind it, but it\\'s not necessarily advertising for its products,\" says Mr Stocker.\\n\"It\\'s made them more visible, and helped create more interest in the category... and hopefully people will buy more products.\"\\nThe North Face sales in China jumped more than 20% in 2013 from the year before.\\nMeanwhile, as retailers try to come up with innovative ways to engage with consumers online, Singaporean online shopper Chelsea Lin says that overall, it is just easier to get more feedback on purchases through social networks versus going into a physical store.\\n\"It becomes quite addictive, to the point where it\\'s a weekly thing that I would buy something,\" the 30-year-old office worker says.\\n\"It\\'s like you can shop everyday if you shop online.\"\\nMore on This Story\\n', u'The Interview: A guide to the cyber attack on Hollywood\\nSony film The Interview has featured highly in hackers\\' demands\\nA month after hackers launched an attack on Sony Pictures, the fallout has led the Hollywood studio to cancel the release of satirical comedy The Interview, which involves a plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.\\nThe initial hack, which exposed embarrassing emails and personal details about some of the world\\'s biggest movie stars, has escalated after the supposed hackers made threats against cinemas showing the film.\\nIt is turning into one of  the most difficult and damaging episodes in recent Hollywood history. Here, we examine the complicated catalogue of events.\\nHow did it start?\\nOn November 22, there were signs that Sony\\'s computer system had been compromised when skulls appeared on employees\\' screens with a message threatening to expose \"secrets\" from data obtained in a sophisticated hack.\\nThis initially caused crippling computer problems for workers at Sony, who were forced to work with pen and paper. \"We even fired up our fax machine,\" one employee told the LA Times.\\nSony initially said they were dealing with an \"IT matter\", but later acknowledged the hack to staff, calling it a \"brazen attack\" comprised of \"malicious criminal acts\".\\nWho is responsible?\\nNorth Korean TV denied involvement in the cyber attack\\nA unknown group calling itself #GOP - later identified as Guardians of Peace - claimed it was behind the cyber attack , prompting the FBI to launch an investigation. Their name has been attached to subsequent leaks of information.\\nSpeculation has since mounted that North Korea may have had a hand in the attack as a form of retaliation for Sony\\'s release of The Interview.\\nA North Korean foreign ministry spokesman called the movie an \"act of terrorism\" in June , promising \"merciless\" retaliation if it was released.\\nThe country eventually denied involvement, but heaped praise on the hack, calling it a \"righteous deed\". The secretive nation\\'s ability to wage cyber warfare is not unknown, but it has not previously used the name Guardians of Peace.\\nNews network Bloomberg has reported that the perpetrators worked from a hotel in Thailand, while unnamed Sony executives told TMZ the hackers were helped by insiders who knew where the most embarrassing information could be found. US media quoted anonymous officials as saying that the FBI had linked North Korea to the attacks.\\nWhy was the release of The Interview pulled?\\nHackers have warned cinemas against screening The Interview\\nThe fallout from the hack escalated after the \"Guardians of Peace\" claimed they would attack cinemas showing the Sony film. They alluded to 9/11 in their message and said it was a response to the \"greed of Sony Pictures\".\\nThe film\\'s New York premiere was cancelled and cinema chains cancelled screenings, leading Sony to announce that it had \"decided not to move forward with the planned December 25 theatrical release\".\\nHowever the decision has been greeted with incredulity by some in Hollywood.\\n\"Wow. Everyone caved,\" actor Rob Lowe wrote on Twitter . \"The hackers won. An utter and complete victory for them. Wow.\"\\nComedian Jimmy Kimmel tweeted that the decision by theatres to refuse to show the film was \"an un-American act of cowardice that validates terrorist actions and sets a terrifying precedent.\"\\nWhat did the hackers steal?\\nAnnie - starring Cameron Diaz - has been leaked as a result of the hack\\nBefore the controversy around The Interview, reams of data considered confidential by Sony - and some of the company\\'s prime assets - were stolen in the hack.\\nAn early version of a script for the next James Bond movie, Spectre, was leaked but failed to halt production.\\nFive Sony films, including the new and unreleased version of Annie, turned up on illegal file-sharing sites and were downloaded up to a million times. Brad Pitt\\'s Fury, which had already hit cinema screens, was also shared.\\nWhat information has been revealed?\\nA whole host of Sony\\'s private company information has apparently been exposed to the public, including bosses\\' salaries and employees\\' social security information.\\nStrings of confidential emails between Sony workers have also been circulated and proved to be the most sensitive and embarrassing leaks.\\nThe emails revealed that:\\nFemale film stars including Amy Adams and Jennifer Lawrence were paid less than their male co-stars.\\nSony executive Amy Pascal made jokes about black-themed movies that might be among President Obama\\'s favourites.\\nAngelina Jolie was branded a \"minimally talented spoiled brat\" in a private email from producer Scott Rudin.\\nGeorge Clooney lost sleep over bad reviews for The Monuments Men and emailed Pascal to say: \"I\\'ve let you all down. Not my intention. I apologize. I\\'ve just lost touch\\x85 Who knew?\"\\nSony has contacted some media outlets asking them to exercise caution over the leaked material they report on.\\nHow did Hollywood respond?\\nOscar winner Aaron Sorkin has railed against the fall-out of the hack\\nA-listers at the heart of the revelations have maintained a dignified silence.\\nBut screenwriter and producer Aaron Sorkin wrote in the New York Times of his anger at the hack, accusing the media of aiding and abetting the cyber criminals by sifting through the leaked information and reporting the most salacious findings. He hit out at Hollywood for doing little to protect the dignity of Sony employees, whose personal data has been stolen.\\nJames Franco and Seth Rogen, stars of The Interview, have also commented publicly on the hack, using colourful language on US \"shock jock\" Howard Stern\\'s show to refer to the \"stolen information\", adding that its circulation is \"doing exactly what these criminals want\".\\nMore on This Story\\n', u'Media playback is unsupported on your device\\nStar Wars and Lord of the Rings in a one man show\\n17 December 2014 Last updated at 00:00 GMT\\nHe has a strong claim to being the world\\'s greatest living geek actor.\\nCanadian Charlie Ross has been touring around the globe with his one-man shows of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings for 14 years.\\nA self-confessed geek, his big breakthrough came not from a theatre review, but a review in technology blog Slashdot.\\nIt brought him to the attention of the \"George Lucas family\", who approved of his endeavours, allowing him to play to thousands at Star Wars conventions.\\nVideo Journalist: Dougal Shaw\\n', u\"Quantum thinking: Cats to computers\\nContinue reading the main story\\nThis interactive video is a new technology being trialled by the BBC Connected Studio innovation programme and is best viewed with the latest version of Flash.  It does not currently work on iOS or Android mobile devices or tablets. You can find a non-interactive version of the content below.\\nContinue reading the main story\\nQuantum physics is weird. Things can be in two places at once or spinning in two different directions at the same time.\\nWe can normally ignore this absurdity since  it only happens at the microscopic scale.  However, soon machines  that exploit these bizarre features could revolutionise computing.\\nConventional computers store and process information as bits. A bit can be a 1 or a 0. A modern computer chip  has millions (even billions) of electronic switches that can either be on to represent 1 or off to represent 0. The progress in computing over the past 70 years has been to shrink and speed up these switches.\\nThe Colossus was the first electronic computer - these are valves from a recreation of the 1944 version\\nA quantum computer works very differently. Because it uses as its bits tiny particles , either atoms or subatomic particles, these are subject to the laws of quantum physics.\\nThat means they can be in two states at the same time, so a quantum bit (or qbit) can be a 1 or a 0 or a 1 and a 0 at the same time.  I will say that again.  A qbit can be both a 1 and a zero at the same time.\\nSo why might this revolutionise computing?\\nFor all their amazing performance, conventional computers have their limitations. There are some problems so difficult that all the computers that have ever been built could work together and still not find the answer before the sun explodes.\\nOptimization\\nAs a simple example of the sort of problem we are talking about,  imagine a travelling sales representative.  He or she has to go to 10 different locations in a day and wants to work out which is the most efficient order to make the visits.\\nThis is actually a huge mathematical problem, with more than 3.5 million possible combinations that each has to be worked out before the best solution can be reached. Increase the number of locations from 10 to 20 and there are more than two quintillion possible solutions (that's 2 followed by 18 zeros).\\nNow consider not cities, but stars.  There are 300 billion solar systems in our galaxy.  No surprise then that Nasa is very interested in quantum computing.\\nThis is an example of what's called an optimization problem and our world is awash with them.  From designing the right formula for a new drug to trying to get machines to think like humans.\\nA quantum computer could crunch this sort of problem pretty swiftly because its qbits are able to consider all the possible answers at the same time and then pick the best answer.\\nA D-Wave machine has been installed at Nasa Ames Research Center in California\\nSo how close are we to real quantum computers? Canadian company D-Wave will sell you one now.  Although there is a lively debate among physicists as to whether the D-wave machine is really a quantum computer. (That debate is too technical and complex to even attempt to summarise here).\\nCloser to home, researchers at Oxford University have succeeded in controlling charged calcium atoms (ions) in a quantum state. At the moment, the apparatus to do this fills a basement.\\nShrink this down and add a million or two more qbits and they will have a quantum computer. That, they say, is probably a decade or more away. The physicists involved in this work are very obviously excited to be at the start of a science that could fundamentally change our world.\\nNewsnight's David Grossman explains quantum computers (this video is not interactive)\\nInteractive video produced by Laura Mulholland and Dominic Bailey in conjunction with Connected Studios\\nMore on This Story\\n17 JANUARY 2014, SCIENCE & ENVIRONMENT\\nRelated Internet links\\n\", u'Virtual galleries open new markets for art\\nBy Jane O\\'Brien BBC News, Miami\\nDoes art make financial sense?\\nEvery year in December, Miami Beach becomes the epicentre of the art world. Tens of thousands of people flock to Art Basel where sales of art reportedly top $3bn (\\u01411.9bn).\\nIn the hyper-party atmosphere billionaires rub shoulders with struggling artists and serious collectors vie with amateurs to spot a potential masterpiece. Thanks to the internet, art has never been more accessible and new markets are opening up around the world.\\n\"China is a really exciting opportunity for us,\" says Carter Cleveland, the 28-year-old founder of Artsy, an online database featuring works by 25,000 artists and more than 2,000 galleries around the world.\\nOfficially launched in 2012, Artsy has attracted $26m in funding and has some big name backers such as Paypal cofounder Peter Thiel. The site makes money by charging galleries a monthly subscription to list their art.\\nCarter Cleveland, pictured with Wendi Murdoch, Ivanka Trump and Lauren Remington Platt at Art Basel\\nThe company has an office in Hong Kong but has yet to establish a presence in mainland China. In an effort to make contacts and pave the way for expansion, Artsy hosted a celebrity bash where the star of the party was Chinese choreographer and artist Shen Wei.\\n\"China is a lot more challenging because they have their own infrastructure and their own social media and their own search engines,\" says Cleveland. \"So when you want to expand into mainland China it takes a much more thoughtful approach.\"\\nChina\\'s contemporary art market didn\\'t exist much before 2000. It has now overtaken the US, according to Berlin-based Artnet, another online platform that specialises in art auctions. In fact, growth in China appears to be driving the global art industry, which is worth an estimated $66bn.\\nUnderscoring the boom in sales, several Chinese galleries staged exhibitions at Art Basel in Miami Beach, including newcomer Beijing Commune. Director Lu Jingjing says the gallery is considering joining Artsy but is still weighing the benefits.\\n\"Search engines are very well developed too so you have to measure whether it\\'s worth the investment,\" she says.\\nBeijing Commune currently uses WeChat - a mobile messaging app that has 438 million users, mainly in China.\\nBeijing Commune director Lu Jingjing is currently weighing her options as to what platforms she uses\\n\"It\\'s not a selling tool like Artsy or Artnet. But you can make your own newsletter about your exhibitions and you know how many people have read it,\" says Lu Jingjing.\\nHsinke Lee is head of exhibitions at Long March Space, another Chinese gallery at Art Basel. She thinks digital platforms are a \"positive\" development and predicts they will have a greater role in the Chinese art market.\\nShe says many people already buy most things through Taobao, the Chinese equivalent of Amazon, and art is no different.\\n\"I\\'ve noticed a lot of collectors purchase works without viewing them first in person. I myself have clients like that. Even when the work is worth close to a million dollars, they don\\'t need to see it,\" she says.\\nRhonda Long-Sharp learnt from her own experience of buying a Picasso online that turned out to be a fake\\nBut the international art market is largely unregulated and other experts warn that buying online poses hazards for the unwary.\\n\"You\\'re only as safe and secure as the ethics of the particular dealer you\\'re dealing with,\" says Rhonda Long-Sharp, a former lawyer who now owns an eponymous gallery in Indianapolis. She was exhibiting at Scope, another art fair timed to coincide with Art Basel in Miami Beach. Ironically, she switched careers after buying a fake Picasso online.\\n\"From that I learned a great deal about the art market and the art world,\" she says.\"When a collector looks online and says he wants a Warhol, he\\'s going to find hundreds of galleries that purport to handle Warhol.\\n\"But you don\\'t know if they\\'re a legitimate gallery, you don\\'t know if the piece is authentic and you don\\'t know if the condition is outstanding or if it\\'s been restored so much that the value is really a smidgen of what it should be.\"\\nNevertheless, she pays Artnet \"a fair amount of money\" for a gallery page. She says it is an important marketing tool for Long-Sharp Gallery and good for collectors who want to learn more about a piece.\\n\"Online impacts fairs like this because if you see something here that you like you can go online and look at other works by the artist. People often come here with their cameras, snap a shot of the piece and snap a shot of the name tag. You\\'ll hear from them maybe two months later.\"\\nFar from competing with physical fairs such as Art Basel, digital and social media have become an integral part of the event. In addition to 73,000 visitors, Art Basel Miami has 300,000 Facebook followers, 150,000 Twitter followers and 100,000 on Instagram.\\nOrganisers also tapped into that online community to launch a crowdfunding campaign for non-profit art organisations that generally don\\'t attract major investment but are seen as essential incubators for emerging talent.\\nBig businesses are also entering the digital art world. The Swiss bank UBS, a major sponsor of Art Basel, hopes to meet the surging demand for information with the launch of Planet Art, an app that aggregates news about contemporary art.\\nPeter Dillon, head of global art platforms at UBS, says it cuts through the clutter in a complicated market. \"It expands access to the art world and the art market. For somebody who is new to it, this is a great way to get real-time information,\" he says.\\n\"It\\'s data led so it\\'s objective. It\\'s based on an algorithm that uses the facts in articles to index and organise them. It\\'s applying a skill set that we have as a bank to the art world.\"\\nBut although UBS has a massive corporate art collection, Dillon says the bank does not advise clients on buying art as an investment. A sentiment echoed by Art Basel director Marc Spiegler.\\n\"The whole issue of art as an investment makes me somewhat queasy,\" he says. \"A lot of people have tried to do art funds, almost all of them have failed. Historically the collections that appreciated the most are the ones that went against the market. There is always a speculative market, there\\'s always a bubble - but it\\'s small.\\n\"Our fair is not about monetising mini-bubbles; our fair is about building a sustainable support base for the careers of artists and their galleries. I think people should buy work that they like.\"\\nMore on This Story\\n', u'Taking stock: Tech to thwart retail\\'s worst miscreants\\nBy Ian Hardy Technology reporter, New York\\nRebecca Minkoff is a very busy woman. And like all successful fashion designers she likes to be at least a few steps ahead of the rest of us.\\nChristmas shopping gets tech boost\\nSo it\\'s not surprising her first flagship store - in the heart of Soho, New York City - is a cleverly concealed mix of bricks and bandwidth.\\nA partnership with eBay means that shoppers can log on in the shop via a giant interactive screen, to make a wish list of items.\\nOnce in the changing room, the shopper can also communicate digitally with tablet-carrying sales associates, who then bring over requested clothes in different sizes and colours.\\nOnce a decision has been made the guest can then pay for merchandise without ever standing in a queue or seeing a cash register.\\nRebecca loves the idea of providing her customers with a physical shopping experience that brings with it all the best bits from an online world that her younger customers crave.\\nBut as it turns out her new way of doing business might also help solve a major problem that plagues a lot of high street business owners - theft.\\nThe high tech fitting rooms serving clients at Rebecca Minkoff\\'s New York boutique\\nSales assistants can check stock status from their tablets while on the shop floor\\nTag it\\nTo enable the customer care aspect of her boutique, every item has an RFID (radio frequency identification) chip embedded in the price tag.\\nSo the in-store system can track the location of every shoe, skirt and handbag within the four walls, including the row of changing rooms which have been painted with a special surface to prevent radio signals becoming cross contaminated.\\nOf course, currently anyone can decapitate a tag in seconds, but Ms Minkoff says the shop is just one step away from a foolproof method of preventing \"shrinkage\",  as the loss of products is known in retailing.\\n\"Today, they could [walk out of the door with the item] because there is a [removable] tag on this, but our next goal once a back end issue is solved, is embedding them in the clothes, bags and shoes and it will become a security device,\" she says.\\nEach price tag has an RFID tag embedded in it, making the items easy to track\\nRebecca Minkoff in her New York shop\\nAnother problem in the fashion world and retailing as a whole is fraudulent returns.\\nOnly 1% of shoppers do it, but it added up to $16.3bn in the US alone in 2013 according to the National Retail Federation (NRF). And it\\'s getting worse.\\nOne trick known as \"wardrobing\", played out countless times especially around this time of year, is to buy a cocktail dress, wear it once, look absolutely stunning for a couple of hours, then return it the next day.\\nSo now lots of shops put the tag in a prominent position on the garment that\\'s super inconvenient for anyone to hide when taking the dress to a one-and-done style event.\\nManagers are also getting stricter about their return policies. Accidentally rip the tag off or lose the receipt? Too bad.\\nWe are watching\\nThat of course is a pretty low tech solution.\\nThat\\'s where The Retail Equation (TRE) comes in.\\nIt is not an organisation that US shoppers know much about, except maybe \"returnaholics\", and its clients are kept top secret.\\nBut the way it works is that a network of shops share information about people who mimic the behaviour of \"serial returners\".\\nThese are people who may, for example, buy a top-of-the-line TV just before the Superbowl and keep it for less than 24 hours every year.\\nBuying a high-end TV the day before the Superbowl and returning within 24 hours is seen as suspicious\\nThe information collected from individuals may vary from state to state, and the return policies differ from shop to shop, so a sophisticated algorithm is needed to identify possible abuses.\\nTom Rittman, vice president of marketing for The Retail Equation, points out that a refused return is therefore an objective result made by a computer, allowing even the most subjective cashier to be removed from the decision making process.\\n\"The factors that Verify-3 (the name of the system) may use for a given retailer include the frequency of returns, return dollar amounts, whether the return is receipted or non-receipted and purchase history,\" he says.\\n\"Verify does not use other factors in authorising returns such as age, gender, race, nationality, physical characteristics or marital status.\"\\nFaking it\\nAnother enterprise where a complete crackdown has long seemed elusive is the art of counterfeiting.\\nBut in a few years it\\'s possible that many products, especially high end ones, will feature a logo or pattern created using nanotechnology.\\nThe particles that make up the patterns are held in place by the surface tension of water\\nThe images are made up of thousands and thousands of tiny dots\\nFluorescent spheres which give out red, blue and green light can also be used to create patterns\\nThe result is impossible to see with the naked eye, as it\\'s a tiny fraction of the size of a pin head.\\nThe logo or design is stamped onto a surface such as paper, glass, metal or precious stones in such a way that particles are held in place by the natural surface tension of water.\\nDr Heiko Wolf at IBM Research in Zurich\\nFluorescent spheres which give out red, blue and green light can also be used to create patterns.\\nDr Heiko Wolf, a physicist at IBM Research in Zurich, claims it would be daunting for even the cleverest counterfeiter to replicate the technology.\\nThat pleases many high end manufacturers, who are constantly on the look out for ways to hold on to their intellectual property.\\n\"Yes, several have been in touch, in most cases they need the technique to print faster, which requires more research and investment,\" he says.\\n\"The other challenge for them is how they can read the nano patterns at a retail location or at customs controls, so they would need to invest in optical detection instruments.\"\\nSome companies have high hopes for the technology after seeing 3D holograms and an endless array of other anti counterfeit measures beaten over time.\\nMore on This Story\\n', u'Sonia Gandhi in hospital after infection\\nSonia Gandhi was the de facto head of the government during the Congress party\\'s term in office\\nGandhi resumes work after surgery\\nLeader of India\\'s main opposition Congress party Sonia Gandhi is in hospital for treatment of an infection.\\nMrs Gandhi was admitted to Delhi\\'s Ganga Ram Hospital on Friday evening, Press Trust of India news agency quoted party spokesman Ajay Maken as saying.\\nIn 2011 Mrs Gandhi went to the US to receive surgery for an undisclosed medical condition.\\nLast year, she was taken to a Delhi hospital for a few hours after she fell ill during a debate in the parliament.\\nMrs Gandhi was suffering from a respiratory tract infection and her condition is now stable, party officials said.\\n\"She is currently under observation,\" a Congress spokesman told AFP news agency.\\nMrs Gandhi, 68, is the widow of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.\\nShe is the head of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, which has ruled India for most of the time since independence in 1947.\\nHer party lost the 2014 general elections to the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.\\nMore on This Story\\n04 AUGUST 2011, SOUTH ASIA\\nFrom other news sites\\n', u'Mumbai attacks \\'mastermind\\' Lakhvi bailed in Pakistan\\nThe attacks in Mumbai lasted almost 60 hours, and saw numerous public buildings and locations attacked.\\nUS bounty for Pakistan hardliner\\nA man accused of masterminding the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks has been granted bail by a court in Pakistan.\\nZaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi is one of seven men facing trial over the attacks in the Indian city, which left 165 people dead.

Across the border, in Pakistan, floods and house collapses have left more than 180 people dead.\\nFive days of heavy rain abated over the weekend, but flood waters in Srinagar have risen dramatically. The Jhelum river has flooded large parts of the city and forced residents onto rooftops.\\nResidents have waded through neck-deep waters with their belongings.  Kashmir\\'s Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said the floods were \"unprecedented\" but urged residents not to panic, saying rescuers would eventually reach them.\\nA police official in Srinagar told the AFP news agency that he feared the extent of the devastation was not yet known because phone networks were down and areas cut off.  The army headquarters is also under water along with some government buildings.\\n\"Many people may have died and houses collapsed but we are not getting to know much,\" the police officer said, describing the situation as \"catastrophic\".\\nThe flooding is being described as the area\\'s worst in five decades.\\nIndia\\'s defence ministry said  thousands of soldiers, backed by 25 helicopters and seven aircraft, are engaged in rescue work and delivering blankets, tents and other relief across the Kashmir valley. More than 14,800 people have been rescued so far, and 50 army medical teams have been deployed, the ministry said.\\nTouring the region, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared the floods a \"national level disaster\" and promised almost $200m in aid and compensation.  Mr Modi has also written to his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, offering his \"deepest sympathies\" to flood-hit victims on that side of the border and offering help.\\nMore on This Story\\n', u\"Print\\nIn pictures: India's coal miners\\nIndia is the world's third largest coal producing nation and coal supplies 60% of the country's energy needs, but the coal industry is poorly regulated. Arindam Mukherjee photographs some coal miners going about their work in eastern India.\\nThe coal-rich region in India includes huge swathes of eastern states like Orissa, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Chhattisgarh, and pockets in the central and southern parts of the country.\\nMost miners spend their days tunnelling, digging and extracting coal from the mines. Here, a group of miners are at work in a mine in West Bengal state's Raniganj district. Each group is led by a sardar (chief) who is responsible for the work of his group.\\nMore than half of India's commercial energy needs are met by coal. It is the main fuel for generating power and making steel and cement. But mining is also a major factor in environment pollution, emitting smoke and noxious gases.\\nMany of the miners also suffer from lung diseases caused due to inhaling coal dust throughout the day.\\nCoal mining can be a very hazardous activity and hundreds of miners have died over the years in accidents in mines.\\nPoor maintenance of the mines is a major factor behind frequent accidents. Once underground, the only way a miner can communicate with the outside world is by using an intercom.\\nSunita Devi's husband Santraj Prasad was killed along with 25 others in February 2001 when the Bagdigi colliery in Jharkhand was flooded. She now works as a guard at a mine officer's bungalow in the nearby town of Jharia. Here, she sits at her home with her late husband's photograph and one of her children.\\nMiner Salim Ansari was the lone survivor of the Bagdigi disaster in which 26 of his colleagues died. He was trapped in an underground air pocket for seven days until rescue workers found him and brought him out.\\nLakhan Tanti works as a loader at the government-owned Coal India Limited mine in Ranigunj in West Bengal. He says the company is now hiring contractual labourers instead of salaried employees to cut costs.\\nCoal mines, like this one in the state of Jharkhand, have multiple floors where excavation takes place and often operate 24 hours a day. Here, a group of miners are going deep inside an underground mine to begin work.\\nFemale labourers are hired to clean and collect coal near the railway line in Bailbandh colliery in Ranigunj. The women are mostly dependents of deceased miners and are employed on humanitarian grounds after the death of their husbands.\\nShare this page\\n\", u\"2 October 2013 Last updated at 00:26\\nIn pictures: India's Ambassador taxis\\nShare this page\\nChristmas photographs of Prince George\\nServices\\nBBC \\u0160 2014 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Ambar was known for taking on the powerful Mughal rulers of northern India.\\nAn exhibition, organised by the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture of The New York Public Library, in Delhi recently showcased such \"forgotten\" stories of Africa\\'s role in India\\'s history.\\nAbyssinians, also known as Habshis in India, mostly came from the Horn of Africa to the subcontinent. Dr Sylviane A Diouf of the Schomburg Center says Africans were successful in India because of their military prowess and administrative skills.\\n\"African men were employed in very specialised jobs, as soldiers, palace guards, or bodyguards; they were able to rise through the ranks becoming generals, admirals, and administrators,\" she says.\\nKenneth Robbins, co-curator of the exhibition, says it is very important for Indians to know that Africans were an integral part of several Indian sultanates and some of them even started their own dynasties.\\n\"Early evidence suggests that Africans came to India as early as the 4th Century. But they really flourished as traders, artists, rulers, architects and reformers between the 14th Century and 17th Century,\" he says.\\nThis 17th-Century cloth painting depicts a procession of Deccani sultan Abdullah Qutb Shah. African guards are seen here as part of the sultan\\'s army.\\nApart from the Deccan sultanates in southern India, Africans also rose to prominence on the western coast of India. Some of them brought their traditional music and Sufi Islam with them.\\nMr Robbins says Deccan sultans relied on African soldiers because Mughal rulers of northern India did not allow them to recruit men from Afghanistan and other central Asian countries.\\nThis 1887 painting from Kutch portrays the Sidi Damal, a religious, ecstatic dance form of the Muslim Sidis who were brought to India from East Africa.\\nDr Diouf says Indian rulers trusted Africans and their skills. \"It was true, especially in areas where hereditary authority was weak and there was ongoing instability due to struggles between factions like in the Deccan,\" she says.\\n\"Africans sometimes did seize power for their group like they did in Bengal - where they were known as the Abyssinian Party - in the 1480s; or in Janjira and Sachin (on the western coast of India) where they established African dynasties. They also took power on an individual basis, as Sidi Masud did in Adoni (in southern India) or Malik Ambar in Ahmadnagar (in western India),\" she adds.\\nThe funerary complex shown in the photograph above was also designed by eunuch Malik Sandal after 1597 in Bijapur (in present-day southern Karnataka state).\\nThis painting from 1590 shows an Indian prince eating in the land of Ethiopians (Habshi) or East Africans (Zangis).\\nAfricans also brought their music to India. This artwork dated 1640-1660 shows a player of the African lyre.\\nIn this 1904 photo taken in Hyderabad in the Deccan region, Africans guards are seen escorting a royal procession.\\nThe most celebrated of the powerful Ethiopian leaders in India was Malik Ambar (1548-1626). His mausoleum still exists in Khuldabad, near Aurangabad district in western India.\\nThis painting shows Nawab Sidi Haidar Khan of Sachin. The African-ruled state of Sachin was established in 1791 in Gujarat. It had its own cavalry and a state band that included Africans, its own coats of arms, currency, and stamped paper. In 1948, when the princely states were incorporated into independent India and ceased to exist, Sachin had a population of 26,000 - 85% Hindu and 13% Muslim - explains Dr Diouf.\\nThe main African figures of the past have not been forgotten but their ethnicity has been erased, consciously or not, she adds.\\n\"The people who have heard of Malik Ambar, for example, generally do not know he was Ethiopian. Does it mean that these men\\'s origin was so irrelevant that it was useless to mention it, or is this historical erasure the product of a conscious denial of the African contribution?\" she asks.\\nShare this page\\n', u'Indian official\\'s rage over road works becomes an online hit\\nBy BBC Trending What\\'s popular and why\\nThe internet\\'s \\'bling ring\\' exposed Watch\\nA district magistrate scolding civic officials and contractors for what she says is shoddy road construction has become an online hit.\\nAlmost a million people have viewed the footage of B Chandrakala, the District Magistrate of Bulandhshahr, giving the group of men a dressing down since it was posted on Facebook yesterday.\\n\"So much money is coming from the government, but can you see even one developmental work in the city?\" she says on the video.\\nOne of the people she\\'s addressing protests, but Chandrakala is quick to respond: \"Is this the work that is happening?

His grandfather, however, lived to the ripe age of 110, in the same village in Maharashtra. His aunts didn\\'t die until into their nineties.\\n\"Simple things like clean water, more irrigation, more crops, more affluence added years to people\\'s lives here. Public health, sanitation and antibiotics also helped,\" he says.\\nBut with Indians living longer, their needs have become wider. A health system designed primarily for infectious diseases was finding it difficult to cope with a new and more complicated swathe of illnesses - from high blood pressure to diabetes.\\n\"The top killer in India is death from cardio-vascular diseases . We are still in an economy with an infrastructure which has not progressed yet to meet the needs of someone who comes in with a heart attack, requires an operation, and wants it be done safely and well,\" he says.\\nIndia has some of the best doctors in the world, says Dr Gawande\\nDr Gawande, the son of immigrants from India, wears many hats.\\nIn the operating theatre, he practises general and endocrine surgery . In the medical school lecture theatre, he teaches health policy and management.\\nOutside, he is a writer of best-selling books, mostly riveting essays on the challenges and tricky ethical issues facing modern medicine and about doctors and their mistakes. His recent book, Being Mortal , is an exquisitely crafted and courageous meditation on ageing and death and how doctors can help patients deal with end of life.\\n\"Polio was a big thing, and India made it a small thing,\" says Dr Gawande, 48, who was in Delhi last week to deliver the last of this year\\'s BBC Reith Lectures. \"They got the basics right.\"\\nAuthorities got the vaccine, kept it cold, and made sure volunteers go house to house, village after village, and offer vaccines and track and monitor the vaccination drive. How did India even make this happen?\\n\"Well, India was being very systematic. There was a clear message that we have a goal, we are in it together to eliminate the disease. I actually learnt the checklist idea by touring with a WHO [World Health Organization] polio eradication team in Andhra Pradesh,\" says Dr Gawande. The result was his book The Checklist Manifesto: How To Get Things Right , an old-fashioned, nine-chapter checklist primer for doctors to cut complications, infections and hospital deaths.\\n\"Eradicating polio took over a decade. One of my favourite sayings is by Bill Gates: \\'We overestimate what we can accomplish in two years, but we underestimate what we can accomplish in 10.\\'\"\\nBut on the flip side, many lives are still lost during simple surgeries and treatments, something which Dr Gawande puts down to a \"functional failure in the organisation and operation in how our [Indian] systems work\".\\nThe sterilisation deaths in Chhattisgarh were a reminder of India\\'s weak public health system\\n\"You have very good people with a lot of experience and good training in India. But if you put some of your best and smartest people in dysfunctional systems, it\\'s demoralising for them and it is unsafe for the others. The easy thing to say is that this is a bad doctor and he will be punished and that will solve the problem. But we all know that it is not the case,\" he says.\\nThe death of 15 women at two state-run sterilisation camps in Chhattisgarh last month is a painful reminder of how India is not getting its essential public health care checklist in order - poor hygiene and contaminated drugs have been blamed.\\n\"The Chhattisgarh incident may be the result of contaminated drugs and production chains along the way, and it just goes to show how complex the system is. Having a great doctor only gets you so far if you are not building the checks and the system for how our drugs, or devices, even our cleaning of the operating rooms and the hospitals, how the basic hygiene is done,\" says Dr Gawande.\\nWe talk about his new and most compelling work so far on mortality, and about building a health care system that will \"actually help people achieve what\\'s most important to them at the end of their lives\".\\nIndia, says Dr Gawande, is going through a \"remarkable transformation\" that reflects the breakdown of the family that comes with economic progress, as evident by the rise of retirement complexes and old age homes. The young, having gained economic freedom, are no longer tethered to the needs of the old, and they follow opportunities without really having a plan for their ageing parents.\\nEradication of polio is one of India\\'s biggest public health successes\\n\"The plan becomes - the medicines will take care of it. So [the parents] end up in hospitals; we find institutions which really don\\'t recognise them as people. I think we\\'ve had a failure of imagination [around the world] about what a good life might be for those last years we are all going to have.\"\\nThings will improve, he believes, when more Indians will have access to pensions - \"becoming old doesn\\'t mean becoming poor\" - and simple things like pain medication. Isn\\'t it a bit ironic, he asks, that although India is one of the largest producers of morphine in the world, a patient in acute pain often finds it very difficult to procure it.\\nAgeing is a journey each of us must navigate. In the end, Dr Gawande has a Zen-like prescription for people like me who are getting on in years: \"You live longer only when you stop trying to live longer.\" I will remember it.\\n', u'Media playback is unsupported on your device\\nGoa\\'s fight for independence from Portugal\\n16 December 2014 Last updated at 20:39 GMT\\nFor just over 14 years, Goa remained under Portuguese rule despite the rest of India having won independence from the British in 1947.\\nDespite a long political campaign for freedom, Goa was only set free when the Indian army marched across the border into the western territory in December 1961.\\nLibia Lobo Sardesai, who ran the Voice of Freedom radio station in Goa, was part of the political struggle to win independence.\\nShe tells Witness of the last days of Portuguese rule and the \"intoxicating\" feeling of winning freedom at last.\\nWitness is a World Service programme of the stories of our times told by the people who were there.\\n', u'Print\\nDelhi drivers get lessons in respecting women\\nAuthorities in the Indian capital, Delhi, have made it compulsory for all taxi and auto-rickshaw drivers to attend \"gender sensitisation\" classes where they are taught how to ensure the safety of women passengers and respect them.\\nThe move comes after a series of high-profile attacks on women in the city in recent months, including the much publicised case of a 26-year-old woman passenger who was allegedly raped by a driver working for the web-based taxi service Uber earlier this month.\\nThe woman had used the Uber smartphone app to book a taxi home on the night of 5 December but said she was taken to a secluded area and raped.\\nThe two-hour programme to train Delhi\\'s 100,000 auto-rickshaw drivers was launched in January and officials say 45,000 have already received their training and certificates. \"The clash is not between men and women, it\\'s a clash of ideas,\" a trainer tells a group of drivers in this image.\\n\"Do you know even whistling at a woman or staring at her is a crime?\" news agency AFP quotes trainer Namrata Sharan as telling a batch of 150 drivers at a recent class. Ms Sharan explains to the drivers what actions could be considered sexual harassment.\\nSince the Uber case, the transport department in Delhi has made the gender sensitisation classes mandatory for taxi drivers as well as auto-rickshaw drivers. Mental health charity Manas is helping with the training, which is set to begin on 22 December, a spokesperson for Manas told the BBC.\\nThere has been increased focus on the issue of women\\'s safety and crimes against women since the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a bus in Delhi two years ago. Global outrage forced India\\'s government to introduce tough new anti-rape laws, but crimes against women continue unabated in Delhi and the rest of the country - according to the National Crime Records Bureau, one rape is reported every 16 minutes.\\nIn recent months, some cities like Cochin in the southern state of Kerala have launched taxi services with female drivers - \"She Taxi\" - to provide safe transportation to women passengers. \"She Taxis\" is a fleet of 40 taxis run \"by women, for women\" and is fitted with wireless tracking gear and panic buttons linked to call centres.\\nCampaigners, however, say gender segregation is not the answer and that women\\'s safety can be achieved only by changing societal attitudes and making men respect women. Auto drivers who have completed the gender sensitisation course in Delhi are given a sticker to display behind their vehicles which says \"this responsible rickshaw respects and protects women\".\\nShare this page\\n', u'Print\\nA Tamil superstar, methane and graffiti: Three things gripping South India\\nThe news this week was dominated by the rape of a woman in an Uber taxi - every facet of the story was discussed on social media. But there were other issues that gripped the Indian public this week. Several of these stories came from the south of the country. BBC Tamil\\'s Jagadheesan Leklapoodi takes a look.\\nRajnikanth mania\\nThis week has seen Tamil audiences in a frenzy over superstar actor Rajnikanth\\'s new film Lingaa, released the day he turned 64.\\nEven Vodafone India tweeted: \"It\\'s International cake-eating day. Why? Cos it\\'s Rajinikanth\\'s Birthday! Let\\'s celebrate by listening to his playlist\"\\nBut it was not a week without controversy. A young film critic, known as Arun,  in Tamil Nadu, says his Facebook account was blocked after the company received thousands of complaints when he criticised Rajnikanth.  Facebook did not respond to a request for a comment from BBC Tamil but Arun says they told him about the complaints and said that his name on Facebook - Arun Tamilstudio - represents a company rather than an individual.\\nHe now has a Facebook page rather than a personal account, but says the incident was an indication of the ability of Rajnikanth fans to silence the critics.\\n#StopMethaneExplorationInKaveriDelta\\nAmid the furore over the rape and then the ban on Uber, a rather curious unexpected trend emerged. That was that the opposition to the project to extract methane gas in the Cauvery Delta in southern India was getting a lot of traction.\\nThis is an old dispute. Yet it found its way onto Twitter, presumably because of concerted campaigning activity.  There have been more than 50,000 straight tweets using the above hashtag.\\nIt\\'s all about a project which aims to extract the gas using hydraulic fracturing in the Cauvery river basin in Tamil Nadu and is opposed by activists, farmers and environmentalists. The operation never got under way and was suspended by the government.\\nThe Cauvery river originates in Karnataka and flows into Tamil Nadu. There is also a long-standing dispute  between Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over sharing its waters, dating back to the early part of the 20th Century.\\nGuess who?

The stencils are a clever mash-up of Western pop culture with Indian icons, and the artist's (or artists') style is certainly influenced by that anonymous yet famous British street artist, Banksy .\\nGuesswho spoke to BBC Tamil and BBC Trending: he or she wouldn't reveal their identity to us, but they did agree to answer some questions via email.\\nWhat can you tell us about yourself? Are you one artist or several? Male or female?\\nSomebody who likes graffiti.\\nDo you have a political point?  What's your message?\\nI don't believe it is art's purpose to send any message. It was mainly an alternative way to use a visual language that people are unfamiliar with here. But at the same time they can connect and communicate with the image and subject while being subtly political. It is also about using public spaces and subversive tactics as potent means of speaking about social realities.\\nThe superheroes and Shikari Shambu with Appi Hippi (a character from a cartoon strip) pieces were done in response to the Kiss of Love campaign that has been going on here.  [BBC Trending previously covered the debate over 'immoral acts' in public ] People who were coming on to the streets to kiss and protest are being arrested. But what if fictional characters do the same? Do they arrest them too?\\nWhat are you hoping to achieve?\\nUnfortunately we don't have a culture of graffiti here [in India] and there aren't many artists who choose to depart from the hierarchies and definitions imposed by the traditional art institutions. It's an effort as a visual artist to start looking for new and meaningful ways to engage a wider audience and inspire more people to take up this as a powerful medium of free expression.\\nWhat reaction have you got?\\nAbsolutely amazing so far. Totally unexpected to be honest. Never thought people who don't otherwise care about art and stuff would start talking about it. It certainly seems to have created an interest and opened up doors.\\nWhat kind of risks are you taking - what would happen if you get caught?\\nAs long as the images and subjects aren't very provocative and explicit in nature, which is the case now, it should be ok. But the day it becomes otherwise, it could be a problem and one could land in serious trouble.\\nGraffiti's against the law. What do you say to people who argue it's just vandalism?\\nWhy just point your fingers at graffiti? We live in a visually polluted place. The streets and walls are flooded with movie posters, advertisements, election campaign signs and notices. Are those against the law? Can those also be called vandalism?\\nGuesswho says: 'On the day India successfully sent a spacecraft into orbit around Mars, a tweet with a picture of female scientists celebrating was an inspiration.'\\nDo you really think you can keep your identity secret? The Times of India reported that they guessed who you were and rang you.\\nIt is not a question about if one wants to keep the identity a secret, but whether others would understand the reasons behind that and respect it.\\nWhat are your future plans - do you plan to post artwork beyond Kochi?  Tackle different subjects? Hang your work in art galleries?\\nI would certainly love to expand, explore new cultures and do works that are relevant to the cultural characteristics and landscapes of each place. Yes, there are a few things in the pipeline. An alternate medium like graffiti finding a place in a mainstream gallery space would be a very interesting thing to see, but that isn't something new in the West though.\\nYou made a route map of your graffiti in Kochi. Have any of the works been whitewashed yet?\\nYes, some of them have been. But isn't it the characteristics of this medium and taken as part of the process?\\nFinally, do you mind being compared to Banksy?\\nThat would be too much of a compliment ... He has been in the business for decades and has very high standards that not many can catch up to. But of course, as a new kid in the block, would certainly love to know about his thoughts on these works and hope to meet him one day.\\nGuesswho says: 'Re-imagining popular and iconic images is not really a new tradition in street art. But to use it with reference to the cultural characteristics of the location was the key. The public need to see more unconventional portrayals of women.

In 2002, massive anti-Muslim riots sparked by the burning of a train carrying Hindu pilgrims, left more than 1,000 people dead in Gujarat.\\nA few months before the riots, Mr Kadri moved out with his wife and son from a mixed neighbourhood where he had lived for 24 years to a Muslim apartment building in Juhapura, one of India\\'s largest Muslim ghettos , on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.\\nA year later, his ageing parents joined them. \"The move was prompted by concerns over safety more than anything else,\" says Mr Kadri.\\nAhmedabad, the main city of Gujarat, which was ruled by the new PM Narendra Modi for more than a decade, is among the many Indian cities where segregated housing is alive and well.\\nA range of old reasons like caste and cultural differences - and some relatively new ones such as migration and religious tensions - have led to a proliferation of what urban sociologist Loic Wacquant , referring to ghettos in French and American cities, has described as \"neighbourhoods of exile\".\\nJuhapura, an obscure village-turned-ghetto of some 400,000 Muslims, is one such neighbourhood of exile.\\nThe heart of this dystopian sprawl is clogged with narrow lanes, tumbledown tenements, overflowing sewers and rubbish mountains. Public transport stays away from the neighbourhood. The wider streets are lined by a rash of new high-rise gated Muslim properties costing up to 6 million rupees (\\u014162,000). A forthcoming gated 14-storey property with some 800 apartments promises a mall, club, separate gyms for men and women, prayer rooms and mosque.\\nGhettos are also a great leveller: the stench of rubbish wafts from the grubby low-slung tenements to Mr Kadri\\'s apartment just a mile away, the air is polluted, and the streets are bumpy and pockmarked.\\nJuhapura is one of India\\'s biggest Muslim ghettos\\nThe wider streets in Juhapura are lined by upmarket Muslim apartments...\\n...while poorer Muslims live in small apartments in the ghetto\\'s congested lanes\\nSegregation has inevitably led to curious business opportunities. Sensing that mixed neighbourhoods were fast disappearing and even well-to-do-Muslims were finding it a problem to buy property, Ahmedabad-based entrepreneur Mohammed Ali Husain began a property fair connecting Muslim builders with buyers.\\nMore than 40,000 potential buyers have turned up for the two fairs he\\'s held so far, checking out and buying housing offered by 25 Muslim builders.\\n\"Earlier communities lived in segregated neighbourhoods for cultural reasons,\" say Mr Husain. \"Now the reason is the fear of the other.\"\\nDeep divisions\\nIn a deeply divided and hierarchical society like India, segregated living - and housing - has existed for centuries.\\nMumbai has community-based \"vegetarian only\" housing societies. Delhi and Calcutta have Muslim ghettos, crowded, run-down and neglected. A planned apartment coming up in Delhi promises \"dream homes for elite Muslim brotherhood\".\\nAhmedabad has been always divided on caste, community and religious lines. But, as analysts say, the ghettoisation was relative in the sense that Muslim-dominated areas co-existed with Hindu-dominated ones.\\n\"These mixed neighbourhoods disappeared after Muslims became the main victims in communal riots which have gone on a par with their growing socio-economic marginalisation,\" write Christophe Jaffrelot and Charlotte Thomas in their study of ghettoisation in Ahmedabad.\\nThe divisions of the past appeared to be more cultural in nature; the divisions of today appear to be rooted in fear, distrust and anomie.\\nMr Kadri says he was picking up an order at a burger chain drive-thru a few years ago when he overheard the manager asking one of his delivery boys to not to deliver to Juhapura because, \"people will chop you into pieces if you go there\".\\nRising urbanisation was expected to blur religious and social boundaries, but that hasn\\'t happened fully.\\nSo despite the fact that more than a third of India\\'s Muslims live in cities and towns - making them the most urbanised community of a significant size - poverty and discrimination continues to easily push them into ghettos.\\nEven Dalits - formerly known as untouchables - who escape the stifling caste-based discrimination of their villages to live and work in the cities find that they still end up living in ghettos.\\nKamlesh Revabhai Chauhan builds homes for the Dalits\\nPoorer Dalits live in cheap homes made by Mr Chauhan...\\n...while better-off ones like Naresh Parmar live in houses with air-conditioning and running water\\nKamlesh Revabhai Chauhan is a Dalit builder in Ahmedabad who helps his community members find cheap homes.\\nHe says he has built some 150 tenements and apartments in the last two decades, costing anything between 300,000 and 2 million rupees.\\nThese days, he is building 90 more properties - tiny, self-contained apartments - in Sarkhej on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.\\n\"Dalits are not given housing or shelter by other communities, so they buy homes from me in Dalit areas. They sell their land in the villages and buy homes here,\" he says.\\nHis homes have been bought by policemen, clerks, factory workers,  and traders.\\nUnkempt tenements\\nAzadnagar Fathewadi is one such Dalit ghetto.\\nThe better-off residents live in bigger, brightly painted homes, while the poorer ones live in poky, unkempt tenements on a different street.\\nNaresh Parmar, who lives in a two-bedroom 140 sq yard house with air-conditioning and running water, rents out his two road rollers for a living.\\nTen years ago, he bought this house from Mr Chauhan for five million rupees. There is a swing and a rope-bed on the verandah.\\n\"This is like my village. I like the environment. When it becomes crowded like the city, I will pack up and go back to the village,\" he says.\\nThere is almost what many say is a consensual silence on segregated living.\\nLast month, Mumbai\\'s municipality passed a resolution saying it should stall a residential project if the builder plans to sell it on \"grounds of caste, religion or food preferences\". It is not clear whether this can be enforced.\\nIn the end, segregated housing - now increasingly driven by religious discrimination - is a blight on India\\'s progress.\\n\"This marks the end of intimacy and formal integration of communities that every modern, civilised society needs,\" says political psychologist Ashis Nandy.\\nMr Kadri, 45, offers his example to show how such segregation is harming India. \"I am what I am because I grew up in a cosmopolitan environment in mixed neighbourhoods,\" he says.\\n\"Unfortunately my 12-year-son does not have the same privilege as he\\'s growing up in a ghetto.

Providers of goods and services such as shops, cinemas and restaurants will also have to make reasonable adjustments for their customers, which might include things like special seating arrangements.\\nThe key concept here is that adjustments must be \"reasonable\" -

But, because of their vulnerability, doctors need to take frequent blood samples as to ensure they get the right dose.\\nThis could come in the form of regular injections, or the insertion of a permanent cannula, a procedure which is difficult enough to administer in grown adults.\\n\\'Like a cat\\'s tongue\\'\\nMany researchers have tried to find an alternative solution.\\nNow, Prof Ryan Donnelly from Queens University Belfast and his team think they have come up with a solution. Not one needle, but 361.\\nThe device looks like a small, clear plastic patch about half a centimetre across, which easily sits on the tip of your finger. One side looks quite rough.\\nMicroneedle patch compared to traditional needle\\n\"It\\'s a patch with 361 tiny, individual needles on it,\" explains Prof Donnelly.\\nThe patch feels slightly rough to the touch, something akin to Velcro or a cats tongue. But the individual needles are extremely hard, and sharp at the tips.\\nUnlike normal hypodermic needles, these microneedles only penetrate the top layer of your skin. They don\\'t contact the nerves, which is why you feel no pain. Nor do they go into your blood vessels.\\nInstead they collect the so called interstitial fluid which surrounds the cells in the outer layer of skin.\\nThis fluid contains all the information the doctor requires.\\n\\'Very distressed\\'\\nIt\\'s always worse for the parents - you don\\'t want to see your child getting stabbed\\x94\\nEnd Quote Sofie Backstrom Mother of a premature baby\\n\"Quite often they\\'ll need to have their blood monitored four times a day. If we can use these microneedles instead, we don\\'t have to take any blood at all.\"\\nDr Brady adds: \"There are real problems associated with hypodermic needles, such as scarring and bruising.\\n\"Using microneedles instantly eliminates any issues with scaring, bruising and damage to tissue.\"\\nParents are very much in favour of something that could be applied as easily as a sticking plaster because, as Prof Ryan says, they become \"very distressed\" by the invasive medical procedures their children have to be subjected to.\\nSofie Backstrom\\'s daughter Freja has just turned one, but she was born three months prematurely at 26 weeks.\\n\"When she was born she had blood samples taken almost daily for the first three months,\" says Sofie.\\nShe still has injection scars from that time.\\n\"They\\'re mainly on the back of her hands and feet but on her knees and elbows too - about 20 scars on each.\"\\nSofie would have welcomed a pain-free alternative.\\n\"I think it\\'s always worse for the parents - you don\\'t want to see your child getting stabbed.\"\\nDrug delivery\\nPlastic patch promises pain free injections\\nProf Donnelly and his team aren\\'t the only ones developing an alternative to injections. Several groups around the world are working on similar technologies, including Linda Klavinskis, an immunobiologist from Kings College London.\\nMicroneedles can also be used for drug delivery and she is very excited about their potential. \"One of the most profound effects will be the ability to deliver vaccines at a reduced cost.\\n\"Microneedles are very simple, you don\\'t need specially trained staff and they won\\'t need any of the paraphernalia of a conventional vaccine.\"\\nCompounds can be incorporated into the polymer patches when they are made, and are slowly released into the body once they come into contact with the interstitial fluid.\\nKeeping cool\\nProf Donnelly\\'s team have used the patches to administer everything from insulin to ibuprofen.\\nMicroneedles could also do away with the need to refrigerate vaccines.\\nMost vaccines need to be kept cold to stay effective and to prevent bacterial growth.\\nTrapped inside the polymer patches the vaccines should be stable in a dry state, even at warm temperatures.\\nIt makes the needles particularly useful for vaccination campaigns in remote areas, where delivering and storing conventional liquid vaccines can be a challenge.\\nProf Donnelly  says: \"Up to 50% of vaccines do not work in the developing world, because they\\'ve inadvertently been allowed to warm beyond 38C, or they\\'ve been frozen by mistake, which can damage the vaccine.\".\\nIf a patient receives a vaccine that hasn\\'t been refrigerated properly it may not work and could lead to septicaemia and even death.\\nNeedle stick injuries\\n', u'Media playback is unsupported on your device\\nTory MP on acupuncture, herbal medicine and homeopathy\\n18 December 2014 Last updated at 12:17 GMT\\nTraditional medicines could be used instead of drugs to save the health service money, says a Conservative MP who sits on the influential House of Commons Health Select Committee,\\nIn a personal film, David Tredinnick puts the case for alternatives, and reckoned those who criticise homeopathy are \"ignorant bullies\" who have never studied it.\\n', u'Media playback is unsupported on your device\\nDenmark patients visiting the doctor via the internet\\n18 December 2014 Last updated at 06:24 GMT\\nThe internet is set to make dramatic changes to the relationship between doctor and patient.\\nUsing the latest communications technology, doctors can now diagnose and treat patients many miles from their consulting rooms.\\nMalcolm Brabant looks at the work of one state-of-the-art clinic in Denmark.\\nBBC \\u0160 2014 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

But when should we worry, asks Joan Bakewell.\\nGetting old just happens of course.  It creeps up on you when you aren\\'t looking and suddenly you\\'re forgetting names and losing keys.  At once alarm bells ring -  could this be the first indication of dementia?\\nI am in my 80s now and I would be foolish not to consider whether these irritating incidents are more than simple forgetfulness.  I console myself - wasn\\'t I always forgetful, without taking it as a sign of something significant?\\nWhen I mentioned the problem to my novelist friend Malcolm Bradbury, he sympathised. \"But Joan, you and I have stuffed our brains full throughout our lives, we shouldn\\'t be surprised if some of it begins to fall off the shelf.\" I felt better, and carried on being randomly forgetful.\\nFind out more\\nSuppose I Lose It will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 16 December at 20:00 GMT\\nCatch up afterwards on iPlayer\\nBut now the argument has quickened.  Dementia is growing in its impact as we all live longer lives. It\\'s reckoned there are more than 800,000 sufferers in the UK. When and how will I know if I am one of them?\\nIt\\'s estimated 61% of people worry that they may be afflicted in the future - that number rises to 66% for the over 55s.  At least I am not alone.  Indeed I am among friends.\\nI have known the actors Timothy West and his wife Prunella Scales for four decades. If we aren\\'t exactly in and out of each other\\'s houses, we certainly go to each other\\'s parties, exchange Christmas cards and rejoice in the successes of children and, more recently, grandchildren.\\nOver the past year they together have decided to go public on the fact that Pru has dementia.\\nIt first began with lines. Pru has had a distinguished career for over 50 years. She has starred in some of television\\'s most popular series: Marriage Lines, opposite Richard Briers, After Henry, Mapp and Lucia, and of course, as Sybil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers.   About 15 years ago she began to notice it was getting harder to remember lines.  She put it down to age.\\nHer last stage appearance was five years ago in Carrie\\'s War in the West End.  Of course, work continues with voiceovers which she can still handle with her usual flair and aplomb. But their doctor indicated that her condition would get worse.  It is getting worse, but only slowly.\\nI enter their home exactly as I know it, full of welcome and laughter, cups of tea and theatre gossip. But there are differences - a huge whiteboard in the kitchen lists in order the things Pru will be doing that day.  A trained helper, Meegan, familiar with the progression of dementia, has moved in to live with them.  She goes about her caring with a tactful absence of fuss.\\nWe sit and talk about the how much their lives are affected and it becomes clear there are two narratives here. Pru complains of occasionally forgetting things - \"but then I am 82 years old - surely that\\'s allowed\".\\nBut she is shocked when Tim explains how at a party Pru will tell someone the same anecdote time after time. \"Oh, I don\\'t do that do I? Surely not. Oh how dreadful.\" I hear in her outrage the familiar response of the Pru I know. But her response is characteristic of the denial which is common among dementia sufferers.\\nWhat is dementia?\\nComputer graphic of an Alzheimer patient\\'s brain (left) compared with a normal brain (right)\\nAn umbrella term referring to a collection of symptoms, which may include memory loss and difficulties with problem-solving or language\\nProgressive condition caused by brain disease, currently without cure\\nAlzheimer\\'s disease affects 62% of those living with dementia\\nAbout 800,000 people formally diagnosed with dementia in UK - but only 43% with the condition get a diagnosis\\nApproximately one in 20 people over age 65 have it, rising to one in six by the age of 80. One in three in the UK will have it by the time they die\\nSource: Alzheimer\\'s society , BBC Science\\nThe fact is dementia is changing her and their lives together, but as in the best of marriages it is a shift rather than a catastrophe. Tim clearly feels the loss - when they go out for the evening together they both enjoy the event,  but once back home Pru can\\'t talk about it because it has already slipped from her memory.\\nI leave for home reflecting on how several friends of my generation are now drifting into this unknown world. I wonder about my own forgetfulness and decide it is, so far as I can tell, of a quite different order.  Nonetheless it is evident enough for me to take small avoiding steps -  sticky notes left around the house,  a notepad beside the bed, a list of things to do each day.\\nBut then didn\\'t I do that already when the overload of my busy life threatened to engulf me? I have been a journalist for over 40 years, working in different media and keeping tabs on what I do through well-ordered and sometime scruffy diaries, shelves of files and dependence on the support of agents and editors.   The agents and editors might well say their support has got stronger in recent months.  I happily take for granted their loyalty and friendship.  A network of obligations that keeps me busy and committed is keeping me on track. If dementia looms, I simply haven\\'t time to notice.\\nNonetheless what I\\'ve been learning about early intervention, the memory clinics, the ongoing research, is enough to persuade me that staying alert for symptoms and confronting fears early is the best way to grow old. I know I shall be taking those memory tests one day soon.\\nThe UK is only now gearing up to meet the enormous challenge dementia presents for the future. There will always be a struggle for resources and new skills. If individuals can help with their own diagnoses, rather than hide away from bad news, then that will help.\\nThere\\'s no denying the harrowing experience of families whose members no longer know who they are. But my friends Tim and Pru have shown me that there can still sometimes be happiness and laughter to be got out of life.\\nThe Magazine on dementia\\n', u'Why are hospitals under so much pressure?\\nJoined-up care: The elephant in the room\\nYou need look no further than Salford Royal Hospital to realise the point the NHS has got to.\\nThe trust is generally regarded as one of the best - if not the best - in the UK. It outperforms its counterparts on a whole host of measures from patient satisfaction to waiting times.\\nBut last week it missed the four-hour A&E; waiting time target - dipping below the 95% standard by the narrowest of margins. This is not a quirk. It\\'s been dragged down along with the rest of the hospital sector.\\nOnce you strip out the small units and walk-in centres, where the pressure is less intense, seven out of eight of England\\'s 141 major units are now missing the target.\\nIf this sort of performance continues for the rest of the month, the quarterly results for October to December will be the worst since the target was introduced in 2004.\\nPerformance levels in Wales and Northern Ireland are even lower (Scotland seems to be performing at a similar level to England, although as the data there lags behind the other parts of the UK, it is hard to say for sure).\\nThis is despite ministers in all four corners of the UK handing the health service extra money to deal with winter pressures.\\nHow performance compares in UK\\nNation\\nUsing #nhswinter on Twitter\\nBut what is interesting as you delve down into the data is that it\\'s not just A&E; units that are finding it difficult - there are pressure points across the whole system.\\nNearly a fifth of patients who go to A&E; need to be admitted into the hospital for more complex care than can be given in an emergency department. Sometimes they face long waits (classed as over four hours) before a bed can be found for them. These are known as \"trolley waits\".\\nThe latest weekly figures show they topped 7,000. That is the highest since weekly collections began in 2010.\\nBut hospitals are also finding it difficult to discharge patients. The figures for September , the last full month for which they are available, were at their highest since that data set began in 2010.\\nA significant factor in this is the squeeze on councils\\' social care budgets. Many of the patients who end up in hospital are frail and elderly, and when they are ready to be released need support in the community to get back on their feet. If it\\'s not there, they have to stay in hospital, which occupies a bed often needed for other patients.\\nAnother pressure point is at the other end of the system - before the visit to hospital is made. Both the Royal College of GPs and British Medical Association have been vocal about the workload their members are facing.\\nA recent BMA survey found three quarters of doctors said their caseload was \"unsustainable\" - and that seems to have started impacting on patients, as latest data from the official NHS England patient survey shows they are finding it more difficult to get an appointment.\\nIf GPs are unable to keep pace with demand, the obvious place patients turn to is A&E.;\\nTo be fair to ministers across the UK, they have recognised this. Wales, Scotland and England have all published plans in the last 18 months to relieve the pressure on the urgent and emergency care systems.\\nBut these are all long-term solutions. In the short-term, all eyes are on what happens this winter.\\nSo what next? \"Predictions are very hard to make,\" says Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals. \"What we don\\'t know is what will happen with Norovirus or flu. Services are so stretched at the moment, that all it will take is a spike in those to make it very difficult for us.\"\\nIt seems to be the case that despite all the planning, all the money, and all the hard work of NHS staff, this winter will hinge on factors outside everyone\\'s control.\\n', u\"Media playback is unsupported on your device\\nA night on Norwich's SOS bus\\n19 December 2014 Last updated at 00:00 GMT\\nTowns and cities across the UK are in peak Christmas party season.\\nFriday 19 December has been dubbed Mad Friday as it marks the start of one of the busiest weekends of the year for ambulance services and hospitals as thousands of revellers hit bars and clubs.\\nIn Norwich, the SOS Bus is a year-round service that helps people suffering the effects of too much alcohol or otherwise in distress during a night out.\\nRun by volunteers, and with the support of an NHS Paramedic, the service helps take the pressure off the ambulance service and A&E; by providing a safe place.\\nAs they geared up for one of the busiest times of the year, BBC News spent a night on board.\\nVideo Journalist: John Galliver\\n\", u'The hidden lives of those who care\\nBy Laurence Cawley BBC News\\nSchoolgirls Leah Doak (left) and Claire Stevenson (right) are both carers for their mothers.

That makes absolutely no difference to carers. Carers don\\'t have weekends.\"\\nGeorge, 86, has Alzheimer\\'s Disease and vascular dementia. He and Gill live in Harrow, north-west London.\\nIn the three-and-a-half years that Gill - previously a human resources project consultant - has cared for her father, she has had just 10 days off.\\n\"I now have a very different life,\" she says. \"It is tough and it is difficult.\\n\"When you meet up with your \\'normal\\' friends you realise they are all living \\'normally\\' - they might be talking about a promotion or a holiday or a new purchase. My whole world is caring.\\n\"When you meet with other carers you can have a laugh about the things that happen in our daily lives.\"\\nAs well as setting up a number of coffee mornings for carers, Gill, using her HR skills, has also developed her own courses to help new carers.\\n\"I felt lost and isolated when I started out on my caring journey and wanted to help others, something positive to make my journey more worthwhile.\"\\nRachel and Anjeli\\nTrevor, Rachel and Anjeli Diack\\nRachel and Anjeli Diack\\'s mother has multiple sclerosis.\\n\"Our dad (Trevor) does most of the caring\", says Anjeli, 12, of King\\'s Lynn, Norfolk. \"But he works full time and we are needed to help out.\\n\"In the last six months we have done more and more caring for mum and also lots more cleaning up and tidying up in the house because mum can\\'t do things like that anymore.\\n\"We help with her medication too, which is sometimes difficult to get right with all the different tablets she needs to take every day.\"\\nShivakuru and Meenadchyammah\\n(L to R) Shivakuru,  Meenadchyammah and Anutha Selvathurai live in a small small ground floor flat in Harrow\\nShivakuru Selvathurai removes his spectacles to wipe the tears from his eyes.

They lived first in Liverpool and then in Harrow.\\nShivakuru, 70, knows better than most the polarities of violence and kindness of which human beings are capable. Anutha, 37, has profound learning difficulties and needs round-the-clock care.\\nYet Anutha\\'s considerable needs are dwarfed by Shivakuru and Meenadchyammah\\'s need to give. Not just to their daughter, but to the wider community.\\n\"We have needed so much help,\" he says, \"with our housing problems, language difficulties with the authorities, getting the right support from health service providers and money advice for our daughter who has some intensive and pressing needs.\\n\"We are so very grateful to the UK Government and the British people generally.\"\\nShivakuru has been a residents group champion, he volunteers for the NHS, the Royal British Legion, the Army Benevolent Fund and other charities. He is a multiple recipient of the Harrow Heroes Volunteer Award.\\nWhy does he do it? The answer, he says, is that when he and his family were in desperate need, the UK provided them with sanctuary. His role now, he says, is to give something back.\\nRonnie and Roger\\nRonnie and Roger Lewis sat at Ronnie\\'s craft table\\nRonnie Lewis struggles to speak. \"Some days I can\\'t stop crying,\" she says.\\nBefore her first severe stroke a decade ago, Ronnie, who lives beside a busy carriageway in west Norfolk, was an avid artist.\\nShe still has her bright and airy studio, the walls lined with box upon box of arts and crafts material.

While his late father ran a successful business in the UK, he believes the \"shock\" of emigrating - the \"longing for home\" and a sense of \"isolation\" - had a profound and lasting effect on his mother, for whom he is a primary carer.\\nIn the aftermath of major knee surgery, Mukesh, himself a successful businessman, now finds himself both a carer and a recipient of care.\\nMukesh, who lives in Harrow, says caring brings people back to fundamental needs - of loving, being loved, of giving and asking for the help of others.\\n\"Too many people are almost \\'cocooned\\' from each other - what we all need to again do is switch on our ability to care, by lessening our suspicions of each other,\" he says.\\nJackie\\nJackie Haverson went for the first night out with her husband in four years.

Everywhere you go in Seoul, you are urged to change your shape through plastic surgery. In affluent Gangnam, every wall seems to have a sign pointing to a surgery.\\nOn the train and in the street, you\\'re told you can \"bring your face to life\". \"Facial contouring\" is on offer - \"breast surgery\", \"anti-ageing\", \"eyeplasty\", \"body contouring\". There is \"square jaw reduction\" (mainly, the adverts imply, for men). Or transforming your face \"from saggy and loose to elastic and dimensional\", targeted mostly at women.\\nOne acquaintance of mine complains that her chin becomes painful when it rains. And then it emerges that she went into the surgery for a nose job but got persuaded - or persuaded herself - that it was her chin that really needed its contours changing. The result: a more shapely chin that is also a more painful chin. Despite that, she is now intent on breast enlargement.\\nThis is not a human face - it is more revolting than monsters or aliens\\x94\\nEnd Quote\\nIn this country, parents tell me that they give their teenage daughters a present of what\\'s called \"double eyelid surgery\" which makes eyes more pronounced - \"less Asian\" is the truth of it. Why, I wonder, when Korean eyes seem so beautiful the way they are?\\nThe retort that blares from the adverts on the train is that \"confidence in appearance brings positive energy which can be the foundation of happiness\". Happiness - so easily found at the cut of a knife!\\nExcept that, of course, it\\'s not. There is now a backlash, a slew of court cases where patients - or victims as they might be known - are suing doctors who re-arranged their faces, but not in a good way. One victim said when the bandages came off: \"This is not a human face. It is more revolting than monsters or aliens.\"\\nKim Bok-Soon was persuaded to spend 30m Won (\\u014117,320) for 15 surgeries on her face\\nPart of the problem is that plastic surgery is so lucrative that unqualified doctors have been drawn in - or rather doctors qualified in other areas of quite different medicine. It\\'s alleged that procedures have been done by what are called \"ghost doctors\". In one court case, it\\'s claimed that the advertised doctor slipped out of the operating room once the patient was under the anaesthetic and the job was then botched by the replacement surgeon.\\nOn top of that, it\\'s emerged that some before-and-after photos have had a bit of surgery themselves - surgery of the Photoshop variety.\\nThe upshot is that the Korean Association of Plastic Surgeons has called for tighter rules for doctors and for advertisers. They fear that the bad publicity is damaging the reputation of an industry which is largely well-run.\\nBut they\\'re fighting against the tide. Plastic surgery is very profitable, even with prices that undercut the US and Europe. One of the big businesses in Gangnam, here in Seoul, prices \"eye-shape correction\" at 1.7m Korean Won. That\\'s about \\u01411,000 ($1,500) for a 30-minute, simple procedure. It rises to 12m Won for a \"full-incision face lift\" - that\\'s about \\u01417,000 ($11,000).\\nSouth Korea plastic surgery\\nIn response to a survey of 1,000 patients, run by the Korea Consumer Agency (KCA):\\n70% of those questioned said they had a surgical procedure to improve their looks, and 14.5% said they believed it boosted their prospects for employment or promotion\\nThe most popular procedure was the \"double-eyelid surgery\" - 67.8% of respondents said they undergone the procedure\\n32.3% of those asked responded that the results of their procedures were \"unsatisfactory\"\\nPlastic surgery is like an addiction - if you do the eyes, you want the nose\\x94\\nEnd Quote\\nTranslation is increasingly needed. There\\'s a big market with a similar sense of vanity right on Korea\\'s doorstep: China. According to the reputable Joongang Daily here, two-thirds of the foreigners who came for plastic surgery to South Korea last year were from China, more than 16,000 customers. The press here says that some of the procedures have been so radical - so successful - that passport officials have not believed it\\'s the same person holding the passport.\\nBut maybe Chinese people who aspire to film-star beauty or, for that matter, South Korean parents who think they can improve their daughters through the surgeon\\'s knife should reflect on one horror story going through the courts.\\nA former beauty queen here had breast enhancement which went horribly wrong. After a series of infections, she ended up with one breast much bigger than the other.\\nShe blames doctors for the medical failure but also for never saying to her: \"Look, you don\\'t need this.\" \"Plastic surgery is like an addiction,\" she said. \"If you do the eyes, you want the nose.\\n\"And doctors don\\'t say, \\'You\\'re beautiful enough as you are.\\'\"\\nJi Yeo\\'s photographs were first published as part of a series called Beauty Recovery Room\\nMore from the Magazine\\nIn 1962, Timmie Jean Lindsey became the first woman to receive silicone breast implants in a groundbreaking operation in Houston, Texas.

In Malawi, a research team is conducting the largest-ever study on children into the effects of indoor smoke and hopes its results will save millions of young lives, as our science reporter, Victoria Gill, discovered.\\nEnnere\\'s eyes are watering. Smoke from the fire she is cooking on is filling her tiny, one-room house in a small village in the district of Chikwawa in the south of Malawi.\\nIt is a traditional open fire on the floor of her hut, surrounded by three bricks to keep in the hot embers and on which to rest her cooking pot.\\nShe and her two-year old daughter, who is gripping Ennere\\'s shoulder as she crouches over a warming pan of water, are breathing in the smoke.\\nMost of the small houses here have no chimney. Some of the smoke escapes through the doorway, but there is no other ventilation. Smoke is filling the little girl\\'s lungs.\\nWe\\'re interested in counting cases of pneumonia. We don\\'t want to count dead children\\x94\\nEnd Quote Dr Kevin Mortimer Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine\\nThis happens every time Ennere cooks.\\nLike 95% of people in Malawi, her family belong to what the World Health Organization calls the \"forgotten three billion \", people who have to breathe polluted air in their homes and are being poisoned by their own cooking fires.\\n\"Smoke basically clogs up children\\'s lungs making them more susceptible to infections like pneumonia, explains Dr Kevin Mortimer, one of the lead researchers from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine .\\nIn Malawi, pneumonia is the number one killer of children under five.\\nAccording to the WHO, throughout sub-Saharan Africa, almost one million children every year die from the disease.  Worldwide that number could be more than four million.\\nThe stove being tested in this cooking-and-pneumonia trial has a battery-operated fan beneath the furnace\\nRedesigning the stove on which millions cook, the researchers believe, could be the solution to cutting this death toll.\\nThere are several different types of clean cook stove. The ones the team are testing use the same fuel as open fires, wood (or biomass) but they incorporate a battery-powered fan that blows air through a contained furnace.\\nThis produces a more efficient, less smoky fire.\\nThe Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine team intends to distribute 16,000 stoves in the north of Malawi, and here in Chikwawa in the south.

They respond to a detailed questionnaire about their health before an operation, then afterwards.\\nBy comparing the two sets of results, we can benchmark - in detail - how well providers paid similar sums of money did in improving the lot of patients.\\nProms also contains results for two other categories: groin hernia repair and varicose veins.\\nAnalysis of both of these categories of care found that the private providers did better, too, but that the quantities of data are too small for the analysis to be reliable.\\nAfter conducting regression analyses of the survey data, we can demonstrate how this affects patients.\\nTake, for example, a hypothetical 70 year-old who reported that they had a low score on the general wellbeing measure on Proms - 50 out of 100 - because they need a hip replacement.\\nIf they were to go to a public hospital they could expect a score after surgery of 78.9 out of 100.\\nAt a private one, it would be 83.9 out of 100 - a gap of five points. For a similar patient seeking a knee replacement, the private-public gap would be around 3.4 points.\\n\\'Puzzle on provision\\'\\nIn both cases, the results are highly statistically significant.\\nSince we have adjusted for gender, age and prior condition of the patient, we can say the difference is not explained by the slightly simpler set of cases that private providers tend to take on.\\nBut remember that while, en masse, private providers may tend to do better than public ones, individual NHS providers may beat individual private ones.\\nAnd this is only a small part of the puzzle on provision inside the NHS: it covers just two operations for a single year (albeit common ones).\\nThere is, furthermore, existing academic research that suggests that specialist providers doing a few elective treatments often do beat the pack. This may explain it.\\nStill: Watch this space.\\nAs the amount of NHS provision that is outsourced has drifted up since the early 2000s, we will probably find other areas where new (and that might often mean private) providers tend to do better than legacy NHS hospitals.\\nConversely, we will also confirm that there areas where patients report that traditional NHS providers are best. They have unique variety of services on-site.\\nIf we can get more data which gives us good information on care quality we can, one hopes, work out which is which.\\n', u'Interesting NHS data no-one is looking at\\nLast week, John Appleby, chief economist at the King\\'s Fund, wrote a cry of help.\\nOne of the most interesting and important set of statistics in the NHS is being neglected. And he\\'s right to be annoyed.\\nThe statistics - known as proms - are respected, cheap to collect and provide useful information.\\nBut, since their initial proof of concept, he says, their use has progressed \"barely at all\".\\nI, for one, think this is a terrible shame because they - uniquely in the health service - relate to real care quality.\\nProms stands for \"patient reported outcome measures\".\\nFancier stuff\\nBefore some of the more popular forms of elective surgery, patients fill in a form explaining how they feel.\\nThen, after the operation, they fill them in again. Using that, we can say who is good at getting patients to feel better.\\nWhy is this so important?\\nWell, most statistics on this kind of care are about mortality. Quite often, we struggle to say more than \"well, they didn\\'t die\".\\nBut using proms, we can very easily see whether care quality is rising. And we can also do fancier stuff.\\nFor example, we can see whether GPs - newly empowered by the Andrew Lansley reforms - now commission more operations from very good providers and fewer from the very bad.\\nIf his market-based reforms are working, they should be.\\nSo far, that is not very apparent.\\nThe share of hip replacement operations commissioned from good providers rose marginally from 10.2% to 11.5% in 2013-14 - the first year of the reforms.\\nBut it did not fall at the worst providers, sticking at about 10%.\\nThat is actually a very tiny amount better than before the reforms - but we\\'ll have to wait to see if we get any significant movement.\\nWe can also see evidence of excess treatment within proms.\\nOvertreatment means unnecessary surgery and drugs. It\\'s both expensive and genuinely terrible for patients.\\nFor example, take hernias - that\\'s when muscles near your groin tear, allowing a portion of your intestines to poke through.\\nIt is a condition that affects men, in particular. There were 60,000 groin hernia repair operations in England in 2013-14.\\nIt has historically been treated with surgery - usually by shoving a small piece of plastic mesh between the muscles and intestine.\\nUnneeded treatment\\nThe principal idea is to prevent dangerous complications known as \"strangulation\" or \"obstruction\".\\nBut that is now reckoned rare for men with few symptoms.\\nIn 2006, the Journal of the American Medical Association advised that \"watchful waiting\" was advised for men \"with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic\" hernias.\\nYet according to proms, about a fifth of hernia repairs are for men who report no or minimal discomfort on the proms test.\\nFurthermore, 85% of them report feeling worse after the treatment.\\nThat\\'s about \\u014150m of possibly unneeded treatment right there, hidden in a survey.\\nTim Hughes, a doctor at Kirkbymoorside in Yorkshire, has recently been using proms to encourage hernia patients to consider whether they really need their treatment - and most decide not to have it.\\nWe should be watching proms to see how that progresses in the coming years.\\n\\'Cherry picking\\'\\nWe can also use proms to see whether private providers operating inside the NHS are \"cherry picking\" - that is to say, getting easier patients.\\nBecause the NHS has an inflexible pricing structure, they often get as much money for treating easy cases as slightly harder ones.\\nYou can use proms to do more sophisticated analysis, but - for a start - the average groin hernia repair patient, at the average NHS provider, has a health score of 77 out of 100.\\nAt private providers, it\\'s 81.\\nThat\\'s not much, but enough to say they do tend to take slightly easier cases.\\nBut the private providers also do slightly better by them, since the improvement in scores tends to be a bit higher at the private providers.\\nThey get an average improvement of 8.8 points. For state providers, it\\'s 7.8.\\nProms is perhaps the most interesting data on the NHS that no-one is looking at.\\nGiven how sterile much of our discussion of the health service is, Prof Appleby is right: that\\'s a real shame.\\n', u'Suicide prevention is \\'everybody\\'s business\\'\\nBy Jane Dreaper Health correspondent, BBC News\\nJames Wentworth-Stanley, who took his own life at the age of 21, pictured with his mother Clare Milford Haven\\n\\'First aid\\' suicide prevention course\\nThe death of Charlotte Bevan and her newborn daughter in Bristol has prompted a review into the care she was given.\\nThere are often questions about how such tragic situations might be avoided when family and friends become aware that a loved one is slipping into a decline.\\nTo talk about this most sensitive of subjects, I met a polo player and former social editor at Tatler magazine, Clare Milford Haven, for a coffee in a quiet cafe at Brighton railway station.\\nHer eldest son, James Wentworth-Stanley, was sporty, bright and good-looking.\\nHe took his own life at the age of just 21 in 2006.\\nHe was in his second year of studying Spanish and business.\\nDescribed by his mother as \"a doer\", he also played in a rugby team and held down a hotel bar job.\\nJames had returned to student life in Newcastle a few days after a minor operation had led to a change in mood.\\n\\'Horrendous and alarming\\'\\nClare Milford Haven told me: \"I wish I\\'d kept him under my watchful eye.\\n\"I couldn\\'t force his hand about returning to Newcastle - but I regret it, because then he took his own life.\\n\"It was the most horrendous and alarming experience.\\n\"There was absolutely no warning sign at all - we didn\\'t see it coming.

But the atmosphere would be a non-clinical one.\\n\"It\\'s my dream that this would fill those very vital gaps in services.\"\\nWe drive to a nearby library, where 11 people have gathered for a course called Safe Talk, or \"Suicide Alertness For Everyone\".\\nThe audience - mostly community workers - watch and discuss video clips which demonstrate how to ask someone who is suffering a very simple but direct question: \"Could you be thinking of suicide?\"\\nThe message behind the course is the importance of keeping someone who is  vulnerable safe, and connecting them with services.\\nThis might involve, for example, taking someone to a pharmacist or GP with any medicine they have stockpiled.\\n\\'People have doubts\\'\\nDuring a break, the instructor Chris Brown tells me how the charity she co-founded, Grassroots Suicide Prevention, is working to reduce what had been a very high suicide rate in Brighton.\\nShe said: \"We\\'re trying to make Brighton a \\'suicide-safe\\' town - it\\'s all about education, awareness and training residents with brief courses like this one.\\n\"Research tells us that people considering suicide have doubts about it.

a defensive wall of bone - and a cushioning fluid.\\nBut it is not a simple case of the brain having specific weak spots.\\n\"The brain is protected by the skull, but the upper neck is vulnerable,\" said Peter Hutchinson, a professor of neurosurgery at University of Cambridge.\\nHe told the BBC: \"We evolved to enable a neck with a lot of movement, but the consequence is a risk of injury to the vessels from excessive movement or direct trauma.\"\\nThe vertebral arteries run up both sides of the neck and the blow from the ball caused a dissection, in which the artery ruptures.\\nAntonio Belli, professor of trauma neurosurgery at the University of Birmingham, said: \"The vertebral arteries supply the brain stem, which controls breathing and heart rhythm, so I think that could be why he stopped breathing immediately.\"\\nHow the brain is fed by arteries (in red) and veins (in blue) in the head and neck\\nTypes of injury\\nWhile vertebral artery dissections are rare, there are two common types of brain injury known as \"focal\" and \"diffuse\".\\nFocal injuries tend to be caused by falls and assaults. They are the result of a damage to one area of the brain, which results in a blood clot.\\nThis occupies space and causes pressure on the surrounding brain, starving the organ of oxygen leading to brain cells dying. It is treated by removing the clot.\\nHowever, damage may not be confined to just the site of the impact - known as a \"coup injury\".\\nThe brain floats inside the skull so can collide with the side of the skull opposite the impact causing a \"contra-coup injury\".\\nThe front of Olympic rower James Cracknell\\'s brain was damaged when he was struck on the back of the head while cycling.\\nWidespread\\nThe other class of injury is largely the result of high speed road accidents.\\nThe latest model of cricket helmet, which is said to be more protective, worn by New Zealand cricketer Ish Sodhi\\nIn diffuse injuries the damage is spread across the brain, which becomes swollen.\\nThe pressure builds in the tight confines of the skull and the flow of blood can be impaired.\\nTreatment requires lowering the pressure in the brain.\\nIt is also possible to damage the brain without a direct blow to the head.\\nThe brain sits in fluid inside the skull and can bounce around if there is enough force.\\nIn something like severe whiplash the brain can be shaken around the skull, even though no blow is delivered.\\nMr Belli told the BBC: \"Often what does the damage is not the direct impact, but rotational forces.\\n\"You could argue from an evolutionary point of view, we\\'re well designed to withstand a direct blow, but not engineered well to withstand the rotational forces in a road traffic accident.\"\\nThinner walls\\nThe skull itself does have stronger and weaker parts.\\nA region called the pterion, close to the ears, is the thinnest part of the skull so is most vulnerable to fracture.\\nBut the relatively reinforced forehead and back of the skull can still be damaged.\\n\"They may be thicker parts of the skull, but you can still fracture them if you transmit enough force,\" Prof Hutchinson noted.\\n\"There isn\\'t a safe point or a weak point, you get a lot of damage from the way the force travels through the head,\" added Mr Belli.\\nLasting damage\\nDamage varies hugely from one patient to another - one patient who has a seemingly severe injury can show better recovery than injuries which appear minor.\\nProf Hutchinson said it the lasting damage depended on where the damage was caused as \"some areas are more critical\".\\n\"Bleeding in the motor cortex can result in paralysis while damage to the visual cortex would result in blindness.\"\\nHe said sport was not taking head injury seriously enough, but changes in American football were driving reform.\\n\"In terms of sport, the most controversial is boxing because it is a deliberate act, horse riding creates a lot of serious injuries, and rugby increasingly so.\\n\"There are racing drivers who have had an accident in the early part of the weekend, raced the whole weekend and not remembered a thing.\"\\n\"People need to be aware of brain injury.\"\\nMore on This Story\\n', u'How the West is cutting teen pregnancy\\nBy Keith Moore BBC News\\nChristingle: The Christmas tradition that only got going in the 1960s\\nTeenage pregnancy is a problem developed Western nations have been battling for decades - and though it sometimes goes unnoticed they have made huge progress.\\n\"Here\\'s a story of utter irresponsibility: About one-third of American girls become pregnant as teenagers,\" wrote columnist Nicholas Kristof in the New York Times recently.\\nIt seems like a shockingly high number. And eight years ago it was accurate.\\nIn 2006, this was the cumulative risk of a teenager becoming pregnant once between the ages of 13 and 19. It was calculated by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a non-profit organisation, using data for births and abortions and an estimate for the number of miscarriages.\\nTruly one of the US\\'s great success stories over the past two decades\\x94\\nEnd Quote Bill Albert National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy\\nBut when the same formula is used with the most recent figures, from 2010, it indicates that the number of teenage American girls becoming pregnant is now less than one in four, a reduction on track with changes over the past two decades.\\nBill Albert, chief programme officer for the National Campaign, says teen pregnancy and birth rates have been declining in the US \"almost without interruptions\" for nearly 20 years, after peaking in the early 1990s.\\nThey are down among all racial and ethnic groups in all 50 states.\\nHe describes it as \"truly one of the US\\'s great success stories over the past two decades\".\\nIndeed, the preliminary data for teen birth rates in 2013 suggests there has been another 22% drop in the rate of 15-to-19-year-olds giving birth since 2010.\\nAlthough abortion data is not yet available, Albert thinks it is highly likely that the rate of teenage pregnancy has declined from its 2010 level. It could be that less than a fifth of American teenage girls are now getting pregnant once.\\n\"We do know that three things are happening in the US - the teen pregnancy rate is going down, the teen abortion rate is going down and the teen birth rate is going down,\" Albert says.\\nWhy is this?\\n\"Teen pregnancy drops in one of two ways - either teens are having less sex overall or the teens who are sexually active are using contraceptives and using them better,\" says Heather Boonstra from the Guttmacher Institute, a non-governmental organisation which researches sexual and reproductive health.\\n\"What we have found looking back at just these two behaviours, is that overwhelmingly it is due to better contraceptive use.\"\\nThe reasons why people are using contraceptives better are not clear-cut, Boonstra says.\\nColorado\\'s birth control success\\nReasons she cites include greater awareness of condoms following the aids crisis, changing norms about the age people in developed countries are getting married and having children (which lowers the planned pregnancy rate), and the internet making information more accessible.\\nWhen it comes to the influence of sex education in schools, Boonstra says that while there is evidence it has helped increase teenagers\\' use of contraception and lower their number of partners, it does not explain the declines in teenage pregnancy entirely.\\n\"These declines have happened across all 50 states and here in the United States different states and different school districts have different policies about their sex education programmes, and so programmes are important but there\\'s a lot more that\\'s going on here because otherwise we would have seen variations across the nation,\" she says.\\nThere has been conflicting research about whether reality TV programmes such as MTV\\'s \"16 and Pregnant\" help prevent teenage pregnancy or glamorise it.\\nDespite teenage pregnancy in the US being at historic lows, it\\'s still the case that a much higher proportion of US teenagers have babies than their counterparts in other countries in Western Europe - as Kristof points out.\\nBoth Boonstra and Albert say there are various reasons for the higher US teenage birth rate, including less access to contraception, the US\\'s racial and ethnic makeup, norms around the best times to start a family and the prevalence of abstinence-only sex education programmes in the US.\\nThe reduction in the numbers of teenagers having children isn\\'t just restricted to the US, says Prof Roger Ingham from the University of Southampton.\\n\"In most of the countries in Western Europe, the rates have been going down steadily over the last few years,\" he says. The teenage pregnancy rate in the UK is the highest in Western Europe, which may explain why it has been faster in the UK than elsewhere.\\nIngham, who advised the UK government for 12 years on its strategy to reduce teen pregnancy, says the declines are not due to teenagers having less sex.  As in the US, the improvement appears to be related to more widespread use of contraceptives, which Ingham says is due to better sex education in schools.\\nIn terms of abortion impacting the birth rate, he says there is a mixed picture in the countries where there is good data.\\nThe Netherlands has a low teenage abortion rate and a low conception rate, Ingham says, while Sweden has a similar birth rate but a higher conception rate - in other words, a higher proportion of pregnancies end in termination.\\nIn the UK, the birth rate has gone down more quickly than the conception rate, as a higher proportion of those who are pregnant are choosing to have an abortion than in previous years.\\nSubscribe to the BBC News Magazine\\'s email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox\\nMore on This Story\\nA city government in China has been using security guards to pose as police officers.\\nShare this page\\nDid Vladimir Putin gamble on high oil prices lasting for ever?\\nMost Popular\\n']\n"
